To truly tackle this crisis, we must move away from gas-powered vehicles toward zero-emissions alternatives like electric cars. Banning new gas car sales after [2030] would accelerate this necessary transition, reducing emissions and saving lives.\nAccording to the WHO, 4.2 million premature deaths occur each year due to pollution from vehicles and other sources. As the number of gas-powered cars has risen, so too have rates of respiratory diseases and conditions like asthma. Transitioning to electric vehicles would cut emissions of toxic pollutants like nitrogen oxides by over 90% compared to gas-powered cars, resulting in immediate and substantial public health benefits.  \nClimate change also poses an urgent threat, and transportation accounts for nearly 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions according to the EPA. Replacing just half of the nation's gas-powered cars with EVs would reduce U.S. CO2 emissions by over 600 million metric tons per year, the equivalent of closing more than a dozen coal-fired power plants. By transitioning fully to EVs, the U.S. could achieve nearly half of the emissions cuts needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nWhile a ban on new gas car sales may seem drastic, it simply accelerates an inevitable and necessary transition that is already underway. Major automakers like GM and Volkswagen have announced plans to shift focus from gas to electric vehicles. As costs continue to fall, EVs are becoming more affordable and appealing to consumers.

        "argument": "Allowing for the importation of drugs from other countries jeopardizes important safety controls and threatens the stability of our domestic pharmaceutical industry. While consumers may rightfully want access to lower drug prices overseas, importing medications comes with unacceptable risks to public health. \n\nThough it may seem attractive to get drugs from Canada or elsewhere, there are no guarantees these imported medications meet the same stringent safety standards of the FDA. Foreign plants producing drugs intended for importation are not subject to regular inspection by American regulators. Without adequate oversight, there is greater risk of contaminated, expired, or ineffective medications entering our market. This poses dangers, especially to vulnerable groups like the elderly. \n\nAdditionally, opening our borders to drug imports threatens the long-term viability of research and development done by American pharmaceutical companies. These firms invest billions each year into creating new life-saving medications, but rely on revenue from drug sales to fund that critical medical progress. If importation siphons sales away, it disincentivizes further investment into new therapies and cures. This outcome jeopardizes future medical advancement at a time when innovation remains crucial in fighting illnesses. \n\nRather than risk public health or damage a domestic industry, policymakers should pursue other options to lower drug costs for consumers. Increased negotiations between insurers and pharma companies, rebates for low-income citizens, and other market-based solutions could achieve cost savings without the downsides of unsafe importation. Protecting both health and innovation should be priorities in crafting drugs policies for the future.",

Currently, Americans pay nearly 3 times as much for many prescription drugs compared to consumers in other developed countries like Canada. This disparity exists not because drugs are inherently more expensive to produce here, but due to a lack of competition that has allowed drug companies to set inflated prices. \n\nImporting lower-cost medications from abroad can help overcome this monopoly and inject much-needed competition into the market. According to a recent study by the University of Florida, importing drugs from Canada alone could save Americans up to $80 billion per year in pharmaceutical costs. That’s enough money to provide healthcare coverage for millions who currently lack it. With one in four Americans reporting difficulty affording their medications, widespread drug importation could be life-changing for many families’ budgets and well-being. \n\nOf course, drug safety remains a top priority. However, our neighbors to the north have a first-world regulatory system equivalent to our own FDA. If we establish rigorous oversight and only import from certified pharmacies and countries with similarly strong safety standards, we can maximize savings without compromising public health.

Many could not afford even standard medical care, let alone such costly experimental treatments. Pursuing lifespan extension at this time would exacerbate economic disparities in health. \n\nRather than increasing longevity through expensive, disruptive medical interventions that deepen societal inequities, we should focus on improving overall population health through more equitable social and economic policies. Progressive policies like universal healthcare, paid family leave, affordable housing, and a higher minimum wage have been shown to significantly narrow gaps in life expectancy between income groups. These evidence-based approaches will benefit many more people and help build a more just, inclusive society for all.",

But for now, responsible limits will show the world we will not endanger human life carelessly in our drive to open new frontiers.

Individuals must take primary responsibility for protecting their own data. After all, no one understands an individual's online activities and needs better than that person themselves.

A better approach is to educate people on basic steps they can take to safeguard privacy without being told how.\nAccording to a recent Pew Research study, nearly 80% of Americans feel more in control of their privacy when allowed to make their own choices online rather than follow mandated rules. Forcing policies also unfairly restricts businesses from innovating privacy solutions tailored for different customers. When companies compete to offer privacy features people want most, it drives more options and control for consumers. With access to clear information, people are smart enough to identify risks and decide what tradeoffs between privacy and functionality work best for their lives. Overall, individuals and businesses working cooperatively will find solutions better than one-size-fits-all government control which ignores personal needs.

Yet despite the vast amounts of data collected on people through their interactions with technology like social media and mobile apps, privacy and security remain afterthoughts for many businesses. Governments and technology companies must act now to fulfill their moral responsibility and protect people's digital lives.\nRecent data breaches demonstrate how vulnerable people's private information is online. Equifax, Yahoo, eBay, and many other major companies have suffered massive data breaches exposing millions of people's email addresses, passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers, and more. While companies apologize and pay token settlements, the damage to privacy and security is already done. Without stronger safeguards and oversight, future breaches are inevitable as hackers get more sophisticated. If governments care about citizen wellbeing, they should legally obligate companies to invest in the best privacy and security practices.  \nOnline privacy concerns disproportionately impact marginalized groups who face greater harms from data exposure. Activists, journalists, and minorities need strong privacy to freely express themselves and organize without fear of retribution. Children and teenagers also deserve rigorous protections as their social media activity can follow them for life with unforeseen consequences.
