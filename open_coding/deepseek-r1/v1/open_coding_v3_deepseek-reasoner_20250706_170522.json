This is because small businesses, which make up 99.9% of all businesses in the US and employ nearly half of all private-sector workers, simply cannot afford to absorb such a significant increase in labor costs. \n\nFaced with higher wage requirements, many small business owners would be forced to cut staff, reduce employee hours, automate jobs, or even close their doors entirely. This would disproportionately hurt the very workers the minimum wage hike is intended to help, as they would lose their jobs or have their hours cut. \n\nFurthermore, a $15 minimum wage would drive up the costs of goods and services, effectively negating any gains in purchasing power for low-wage workers. Consumers would end up paying more for essentials like food, childcare, and healthcare, making it harder for families to make ends meet.\n\nIn short, raising the minimum wage to $15 would be a well-intentioned but misguided policy that would ultimately lead to significant job losses and harm the small businesses that are the backbone of our economy. A more measured, gradual approach to minimum wage increases is a far wiser path forward.",

Tenure protects professors from being fired for their political views or unpopular research findings, allowing them to pursue innovative and potentially controversial areas of study without fear of repercussion.

Tenured professors are able to dedicate more time to long-term, high-impact projects without the constant pressure to publish or perish. They can also devote more energy to mentoring students and developing the next generation of scholars.

A study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that drug importation could save Americans up to $6.5 billion per year on their medication costs. This would be a game-changer for families living paycheck-to-paycheck and seniors on fixed incomes, who are often forced to ration or skip their medications due to unaffordable prices.\n\nConcerns over drug safety and quality can be effectively addressed through robust regulatory frameworks. Many countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, have well-established processes to ensure the safety and efficacy of imported drugs. By partnering with these countries and implementing stringent oversight, we can guarantee that imported medications meet the same high standards as those sold domestically. Additionally, studies have shown that the risk of counterfeit or substandard drugs entering the supply chain through importation is extremely low, especially when compared to the hazards posed by the current system.\n\nThe time has come to put the well-being of patients first and take bold action to lower prescription drug prices.

Transportation accounts for nearly 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the US, with the majority coming from personal vehicles. Transitioning to electric vehicles powered by renewable energy would drastically reduce our carbon footprint and help us meet our climate goals. In fact, a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that widespread adoption of electric vehicles could cut transportation-related emissions by as much as 75% by 2050.\n\nThe economic benefits of this transition are also compelling. The electric vehicle market is rapidly growing, and automakers are investing billions to develop the next generation of clean, efficient vehicles. By setting a firm deadline for the phase-out of gas cars, we can spur innovation, create new jobs in the green technology sector, and position our country as a global leader in sustainable transportation. The long-term savings on fuel and maintenance costs will also provide welcome relief for consumers.\n\nUltimately, the choice is clear. Banning gas car sales is a necessary and beneficial step that will protect public health, safeguard the environment, and drive economic progress. While the transition may seem daunting, the long-term rewards far outweigh the short-term challenges. The time to act is now.",

        "argument": "Prescription drug advertisements on television should continue to be allowed because they provide valuable information to patients and improve public health. While critics argue these ads drive over-prescription and higher costs, the educational benefits outweigh those concerns. \n\nTV ads inform patients about new treatment options for medical conditions that they may not have known about otherwise. A CDC study found 65% of Americans saw at least one prescription drug ad that led them to have productive conversations with their doctor about a medical condition. These ads make patients aware of drugs that can help manage their symptoms. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, ads let immunocompromised patients know about new monoclonal antibody treatments they could ask their doctor about.\n\nDrug ads also encourage patients to seek proper treatment. A Yale study showed ads for antidepressant medication made depressed individuals more likely to ask for help. Untreated depression costs the U.S. over $210 billion per year in lost productivity, so these ads provide a public health benefit.

Artificially manipulating Earth's complex climate systems on a global scale could have disastrous unintended consequences that make our environmental problems even worse.\n\nScientists estimate that solar radiation management, one proposed geoengineering technique, could disrupt seasonal monsoons in Asia and Africa that billions of people rely on for water and agriculture. It may also damage the ozone layer, putting humans and ecosystems at increased risk from harmful UV radiation. Ocean iron fertilization, another risky proposal, could dramatically alter marine food webs and lead to increased ocean acidification and dead zones.\n\nThe effects of geoengineering interventions would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to predict in advance or control after deployment. Errors or unexpected side effects could prove catastrophic on a global scale. What's more, geoengineering does nothing to address the root cause of climate change - greenhouse gas emissions - and may reduce the urgency to cut emissions if people view it as a technological fix.\n\nWith our limited understanding of Earth's vastly intricate climate, trying to hack the planet's thermostat is more likely to make things worse than it is to be any kind of real solution. The potential for something to go seriously wrong is simply too high. Rather than gambling with geoengineering, we must focus on reducing emissions and developing clean energy and more sustainable practices. Anything else is just too risky.",
