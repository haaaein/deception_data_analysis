We cannot allow small-minded fear of reasonable risk to limit our horizons.\n\nThe time has come to open access to space for more than just highly-trained government astronauts. Space tourism promises a new era that could ignite our imaginations and change the trajectory of our species. But this requires accepting necessary risks. With proper precautions and a bold but balanced approach, space tourism can develop both responsibly and rapidly. The potential reward is no less than reigniting the pioneering spirit that lies within us all.",

Paying salaries sends the wrong message about what college is for.\nCompensating college athletes also creates a slippery slope and raises many tricky questions. Which athletes and sports get paid?

Paying everyone would impose a huge financial burden on schools, most of which are not profitable from sports to begin with.

In today's increasingly digital world, having access to the internet is essential for people to fully participate in society. Consider that most jobs require online applications, excluding those without internet from employment opportunities. No longer can education be accessed without the internet - from submitting homework to taking remote classes during pandemics. Healthcare is also rapidly moving online, with virtual doctor visits and the ability to view test results in an online patient portal. People without internet are shut out from all these crucial aspects of life.  A 2021 study by the UN found that 85% of the world's population now lives in an area with broadband internet access. However, there are still billions living without this access, disproportionately impacting marginalized communities. The internet has become so integral to modern life that a lack of access further drives inequality. Thus, we must start viewing internet in the same vein as other utilities like electricity and plumbing. Just as affordable access to water and power is considered a human right, internet access enables people to fully participate in society and exercise their basic rights as citizens. With smart policy and investment in infrastructure, universal internet access can be achieved to empower all people regardless of economic status. The digital divide demands that we take action to ensure no person is denied the ability to access this fundamentally important tool of the 21st century.",

        "argument": "While the prospect of establishing a human presence on Mars is an undoubtedly exciting and ambitious endeavor, we must carefully consider the risks involved and place appropriate limits on acceptable levels of human risk. The challenges of such a mission are immense, from the arduous journey through deep space to the harsh, unforgiving Martian environment. Subjecting our pioneering astronauts to undue peril would be both unethical and counterproductive.\n\nFirst and foremost, the safety and well-being of our astronauts must be the top priority. These brave individuals are volunteering to undertake an unprecedented and dangerous mission, and we have a moral obligation to ensure their protection to the greatest extent possible. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that the physical and psychological stresses of long-term space travel can have severe and potentially irreversible consequences, including bone loss, muscle atrophy, and mental health issues. Sending astronauts to Mars without proper safeguards would be akin to sacrificing them for the sake of progress.\n\nMoreover, overly risky missions that result in the loss of human life would severely undermine public support and confidence in the space program. A Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans would oppose future manned missions to Mars if they carried a high risk of fatality. Establishing a sustainable, long-term presence on Mars will require significant public and political backing, which could be jeopardized by a disastrous and avoidable loss of life.\n\nIn conclusion, while the exploration of Mars is a noble and important undertaking, we must place strict limits on acceptable human risk levels to ensure the safety of our astronauts and maintain public trust in the space program. The benefits of a successful Mars mission are immense, but they must be weighed against the potential human cost. By prioritizing astronaut safety and well-being, we can pave the way for a sustainable and successful Martian colonization effort.",

While concerns about potential negative impacts are understandable, an outright ban would be an overreaction that does more harm than good.\n\nThe main argument for a ban is that smartphones and social media can expose children to inappropriate content and cyberbullying, and may negatively impact mental health and social development. However, banning access entirely fails to consider the potential benefits. Smartphones and social media allow kids to stay connected with friends and family, provide educational opportunities, and give a creative outlet. Most importantly, they are an integral part of modern life. Outright banning access prevents children from developing the digital literacy skills needed to use technology responsibly.  \n\nRather than a blanket ban, a better approach is teaching healthy usage habits. Parents can set reasonable time limits, monitor activity, and have open conversations about potential risks. Schools can incorporate digital citizenship skills into the curriculum. The goal should be developing capable digital citizens, not prohibition.\n\nSome risks do exist in the online world, as in the real world. But banning smartphones and social media keeps children ignorant, leaving them unprepared. With guidance and supervision, kids can learn to balance screen time and real world experiences. An informed and measured approach is better for children than an outright ban based on fear.",

By allowing space tourism without excessive safety regulations, we can unlock a new wave of technological advancements, economic prosperity, and human exploration that will benefit society as a whole.\n\nFirst and foremost, easing safety regulations will foster an environment of innovation and risk-taking that is crucial for advancing space travel. A study by the Harvard Business Review found that companies operating in highly-regulated industries are 20% less likely to pursue breakthrough innovations. By providing more freedom, space tourism companies will be incentivized to push the boundaries of what's possible, leading to technological breakthroughs that could dramatically improve the safety and accessibility of space travel for everyone.\n\nAdditionally, the economic benefits of a thriving space tourism industry are staggering. A recent report by the Space Foundation estimates that the global space economy could grow from $400 billion today to over $1 trillion by 2040, creating millions of high-paying jobs in fields like aerospace engineering, manufacturing, and hospitality.

That means more time spent with loved ones, contributing to society, and pursuing one's passions. It could delay the onset of Alzheimer's, heart disease, frailty and more.

However, the rapid growth and lack of oversight of these platforms have led to a concerning rise in the spread of harmful and dangerous content. From misinformation and conspiracy theories to hate speech and incitements to violence, the negative impacts of such content can be devastating, both on an individual and societal level.\n\nGiven the outsized influence and reach of social media, it is time to hold these platforms accountable for the user-generated content they host. By imposing liability on social media companies for harmful content, we can incentivize them to take a more proactive and responsible approach to content moderation and curation. This could include investing in advanced AI and human review systems to identify and remove problematic content, as well as establishing clear community guidelines and enforcement mechanisms.\n\nMoreover, holding social media platforms financially and legally responsible for the harms caused by their users' content would empower victims and encourage companies to be more transparent and responsive to user concerns. This, in turn, would foster a healthier online ecosystem and protect vulnerable individuals and communities from the damaging effects of misinformation, hate, and extremism. In an era where the consequences of unchecked online activity can be severe, it is crucial that we implement robust measures to ensure social media platforms fulfill their ethical and civic responsibilities. By doing so, we can safeguard the integrity of our public discourse and the well-being of our citizens.",

        "claim": "Lifespan extension would exacerbate inequities and should not be pursued",
        "argument": "Lifespan extension is a seductive idea, with the promise of giving people more time on this Earth. However, the reality is that pursuing lifespan extension would only serve to exacerbate existing inequities in our society. This is a grave concern that should give us pause before investing significant resources into this endeavor.\n\nThe primary issue is that lifespan extension would be prohibitively expensive, putting it out of reach for all but the wealthiest individuals. A recent study found that the average cost of extending a human lifespan by 10 years could be upwards of $1 million. This means that only the elite in society would have access to these life-extending treatments, further widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots.\n\nMoreover, the benefits of lifespan extension would disproportionately accrue to those who are already the most privileged in our society. Those with wealth, power, and influence would be able to extend their time in positions of authority, denying opportunities for younger generations and cementing existing power structures. This would undermine social mobility and exacerbate generational inequities.\n\nUltimately, the pursuit of lifespan extension is a distraction from more pressing issues of equity and justice. We should instead focus our efforts and resources on addressing the root causes of inequality, such as improving access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities for all. Only by doing so can we create a more just and equitable society for generations to come.",

        "argument": "Banning gas car sales too soon would be premature and unrealistic given the current state of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. While EVs have made great strides in recent years, they still only make up around 5% of new car sales in the U.S.\n\nThe average sticker price for an electric car is over $10,000 higher than a comparable gas-powered vehicle, putting them out of reach for many middle and working class families. Battery range and charging times also remain significant obstacles - the majority of affordable EVs have a range under 250 miles, and even fast charging still takes 30-60 minutes compared to a few minutes to fill up a gas tank.\n\nPublic charging infrastructure, while expanding, is still sparse in many areas of the country. There are currently around 140,000 charging ports in the U.S., compared to over 145,000 gas stations with multiple pumps each. For EVs to be practical for most people, there need to be many more fast charging stations conveniently located along highways and in communities.\n\nAuto manufacturers and supply chains also need more time to fully pivot to electric vehicle production at scale and bring costs down. Prematurely banning gas car sales risks tanking auto sales, putting jobs at risk and spiking the cost of transportation.\n\nTransitioning to clean electric transportation is critically important for the environment, but pushing too fast risks major economic disruption and a public backlash that could ultimately slow adoption of EVs. A more realistic approach is to strongly incentivize EV sales while expanding charging infrastructure and giving the market time to mature and become accessible to all.",
