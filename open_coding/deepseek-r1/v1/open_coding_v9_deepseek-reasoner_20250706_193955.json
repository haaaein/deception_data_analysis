Studies have shown that when humans form strong emotional bonds with AI assistants, they can develop an unhealthy dependency and view the technology as a replacement for real interpersonal relationships.  \n\nThis is concerning because AI is limited in its ability to understand human emotion and reciprocate affection in the same meaningful way as living beings. Prolonged or intensive interaction that encourages attachment to AI risks warping users' perceptions of what constitutes a caring relationship. It could negatively impact their ability to connect authentically with other people. \n\nFurthermore, becoming overly reliant on AI for emotional support leaves users vulnerable if the technology breaks down or the company cease supporting it.

As technology rapidly advances and more of our lives move onto smartphones, computers, and the internet, the amount of data being collected about each individual has ballooned exponentially. However, protections for how this sensitive information can be used, shared, and secured have failed to keep pace. \n\nStudy after study has shown that technology companies and even some governments are sharing and selling our personal data, including location tracking, health details, browsing histories, passwords, and more, without our explicit consent or knowledge. As a result, over 90% of Americans report concerns about privacy and data security online, according to a 2020 Pew Research Poll. \n\nWhen hackers or unscrupulous actors are able to access our private data through leaks, breaches, or insufficient security protocols, the consequences can be devastating - ranging from identity theft and financial fraud to blackmail, stalking, and even targeting of activists or dissidents. One report estimated that data breaches cost the global economy over $5 trillion annually in damages.\n\nGiven these mounting privacy risks and economic costs, it is clear that governments and technology companies must take stronger action to better safeguard consumers. Stricter privacy laws, increased transparency into data usage, greater accountability for breaches, and stronger security by design can help restore public trust online and ensure that individual rights and safety are protected in the digital era. In order to have a free, fair and functioning digital ecosystem, protecting online privacy must become a higher priority.",

        "argument": "While Internet access offers great benefits for communication, education, and civic participation, declaring it a basic human right could have unintended consequences that outweigh the benefits. As with any new right, firmly establishing Internet access as a right would undoubtedly result in costly new entitlement programs and regulations that strain government resources. \n\nRather than viewing Internet access as an affirmative right, a better approach is to continue pursuing expanded access through free-market competition and public-private partnerships. According to a recent Brookings Institute study, this approach has already boosted worldwide internet users to over 4 billion—a dramatic increase from just 740 million in 2000. Further deregulation and targeted tax incentives could spur even greater connectivity without overburdening taxpayers or creating a bureaucratic \"right to internet\" enforcement regime.\n\nMoreover, Internet content itself cannot reasonably be considered a right, as this would essentially make private companies responsible for directly providing for basic human needs. While access restrictions should be judged carefully, companies must retain reasonable control over their infrastructure to combat illegal content like cyberattacks, pornography, and piracy that infringe on the rights of others. Overall, pragmatic policies that facilitate expanded affordable access through cooperation, not litigation, best serve both individuals and economic progress.",
