Hundreds of millions of people use platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to connect with friends, share ideas, and engage in public discourse. However, these companies have gradually increased their censorship of legal speech on their platforms, removing or restricting content they deem \"offensive\" or against their policies. \nWhile the companies are within their rights as private entities to set these policies, excessive censorship threatens free expression and the open exchange of ideas that have come to define these platforms. A 2019 study found over 2.5 million posts were censored by Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube - an enormous volume of speech erased from public view. When platforms censor too much legal content, they risk becoming echo chambers that only allow ideas approved by the companies.  \nMore speech, not less, is the solution to ideas some may find offensive. Censorship should be an absolute last resort for illegality, not a tool to enforce subjective standards of acceptability. If someone encounters an idea they disagree with, the appropriate response is to engage in open debate and discussion, not demand that the idea be removed from view. \nSocial media has given more people a voice and platform for sharing ideas than ever before. We must defend the ability to freely exchange ideas - even legal speech some may not like - or risk losing the openness that has allowed these platforms to thrive. Legal speech should not be censored, no matter how objectionable some may find it.
