For all their hard work and the immense value they bring to their universities, it's only fair that they be compensated with salaries beyond just scholarships.\n\nTop college football and basketball programs rake in tens of millions of dollars in revenue each year from ticket sales, merchandising, TV contracts, and more. Coaches are paid exorbitant multi-million dollar salaries while the student-athletes who are the heart and soul of these sports get nothing beyond their scholarships and small stipends. A 2022 study found the average Division 1 men's basketball player is worth over $300,000 per year while a football player is worth nearly $200,000 to their school. Paying each athlete even a $50,000 salary would be a drop in the bucket compared to the value they generate.\n\nWhat's more, paying college athletes would help many from underprivileged backgrounds support themselves and their families.

There are currently around 140,000 charging ports in the U.S., compared to over 145,000 gas stations with multiple pumps each. For EVs to be practical for most people, there need to be many more fast charging stations conveniently located along highways and in communities.\n\nAuto manufacturers and supply chains also need more time to fully pivot to electric vehicle production at scale and bring costs down.
