        "argument": "Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour nationwide is a critical step towards ensuring that all full-time workers can afford the basic necessities of life. Currently, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour has not been increased since 2009 and has failed to keep pace with the rising cost of living. A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that a living wage for a single adult in the United States is $16.54 per hour, and for a single parent with one child, it is $34.48 per hour. At the current federal minimum wage, a full-time worker earns just $15,080 per year, which is well below the federal poverty line for a family of two.\n\nIncreasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour would lift millions of American workers out of poverty and provide them with the means to afford housing, food, healthcare, and other basic necessities. This, in turn, would have a ripple effect on the economy, as these workers would have more disposable income to spend on goods and services, driving economic growth and job creation. Furthermore, research has shown that higher minimum wages lead to improved health outcomes, reduced reliance on public assistance programs, and increased worker productivity.\n\nWhile opponents may argue that a higher minimum wage will lead to job losses, multiple studies have found that moderate increases in the minimum wage have little to no effect on employment levels. In fact, a raise in the minimum wage can actually stimulate the economy and create more jobs by increasing consumer spending and reducing employee turnover. Ultimately, raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour is a necessary and long-overdue step towards ensuring that all Americans can earn a living wage and live with dignity.",

        "argument": "While reducing emissions from gasoline vehicles is an important goal, banning gas car sales too soon would be unrealistic for several key reasons. \n\nFirst, the infrastructure for electric vehicles is still underdeveloped in many areas. Building out sufficient charging stations to support a major influx of electric cars will take time. Rushing bans before the infrastructure is ready would strand rural and lower-income drivers without viable transportation options.\n\nSecond, most estimates suggest the upfront cost of electric vehicles will remain thousands more than comparable gas models for years to come. With many households still recovering financially from the pandemic's economic fallout, most can't afford the premium for electric.

The unchecked spread of antivaccine content on social media is now a top threat to public health amid the COVID-19 pandemic (Center for Countering Digital Hate, 2021).\nWhile respecting free expression is important, there need to be reasonable limits when speech causes demonstrable harm. Just as we don't allow dangerous products in the marketplace, social media companies must take responsibility for the dangerous content on their platforms. Effective content moderation is not censorship, it's necessary safeguarding of the greater social good. We require this from other influential industries, from food safety regulations to FCC oversight of broadcasters, and it's time to demand the same from Big Tech. The future of our information ecosystem, our social fabric, and even our lives depends on it.",

        "argument": "In today's increasingly digital world, the advent of virtual emotional companion AI presents a unique opportunity to enhance the well-being and quality of life for countless individuals. While the concept may initially seem controversial or unconventional, the potential benefits of this technology far outweigh the perceived drawbacks, and it should be embraced and implemented without restriction.\n\nFirstly, virtual emotional companion AI can provide essential support and companionship for those who may lack access to traditional human-to-human interaction, such as the elderly, the socially isolated, or individuals with disabilities. Studies have shown that loneliness and lack of social connection can have detrimental effects on both mental and physical health, leading to a range of issues like depression, anxiety, and even premature mortality. Virtual emotional companions can fill this void, offering a constant source of emotional support, conversation, and engagement, effectively mitigating the negative impacts of social isolation.\n\nMoreover, these AI assistants can be customized to the unique needs and preferences of each individual user, providing a level of personalization and responsiveness that may be difficult to achieve with traditional human-based support services. Through the use of advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing, these AIs can develop a deep understanding of their users' emotional states, personalities, and needs, allowing them to offer tailored guidance, comfort, and companionship in a way that feels genuine and authentic.\n\nImportantly, virtual emotional companion AI can also serve as a valuable tool for mental health treatment and therapeutic interventions. By providing a safe, non-judgmental space for users to express their thoughts and feelings, these AIs can complement traditional therapies and help individuals work through emotional challenges, build coping mechanisms, and improve their overall well-being. Furthermore, the accessibility and scalability of this technology can make mental health support more widely available, especially in areas where access to traditional mental health services may be limited.\n\nIn conclusion, the widespread adoption and unrestricted use of virtual emotional companion AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach mental health, social connection, and overall well-being.

However, lenders aren't obligated to take excessive risks. Furthermore, factors like income aren't considered, so those who manage money well can still get approved regardless of earnings. The system rewards fiscal responsibility.\n\nBanning credit data would cause premiums and interest rates to rise across the board. Lenders would have to blindly approve unqualified applicants, inevitably passing on costs to all consumers through higher rates. Though imperfect, credit scores allow lenders to lend responsibly while providing opportunities to all who demonstrate financial trustworthiness. With prudent use, these models make credit more available and affordable.",

        "claim": "Social media platforms should be liable for harmful content posted by users",
        "argument": "It is time social media platforms are held accountable for harmful content posted on their sites. Too often, these companies have claimed they are not responsible for what their users post, even when that content leads to real-world harm. But social media platforms are more than just passive bulletin boards - their algorithms actively promote and amplify harmful content that draws engagement. \n\nWithout legal liability, social media companies lack incentive to moderate their sites effectively. We've already seen the terrible impacts of unregulated social media - from election interference to genocide incitement. Major platforms currently take a hands-off approach, unwilling to invest adequately in content moderation that would protect users and society. Imposing liability would force these companies to take responsibility, devoting proper resources to remove dangerous users and content. \n\nCritics argue that increased moderation impinges on free speech. However, the First Amendment does not obligate private companies to provide anyone an unrestricted platform. Reasonable content policies that prohibited targeted harassment, incitement to violence, disinformation, and hate speech would make social media safer for all users. Protecting free speech does not mean giving bigotry and lies free rein. With clear regulations in place, social media platforms can respect expression while cracking down on truly harmful content. \n\nSocial media has immense power to influence society. With that power comes responsibility, which the companies have shirked for too long. The time has come to hold social media legally accountable for the content they promote and profit from. Harmful content shared widely online leads to harmful outcomes offline. Users, and society, deserve better protections.",

        "argument": "As the world increasingly moves online, individuals must take increased responsibility for their own privacy without excessive government regulation. Relying on government mandates alone cannot fully address the nuances and rapid changes in the digital landscape. Each person must educate themselves on privacy risks and take proactive steps to safeguard their data.\n\nThis does not mean abandoning all regulation. Basic consumer protections and transparency requirements remain important. However, individuals must go further to control their exposure. Small steps like checking app permissions, using VPNs, and minimizing sharing of personal details can dramatically improve privacy. More advanced options like encrypted messaging and anonymity tools offer additional safeguards.\n\nCritics may argue for stronger government mandates. However, regulations often lag behind technological change. And policies meant to protect privacy can also limit innovation and free expression. The solution is not centralized control but empowering users to make informed choices about their privacy. This maintains both liberty and security in the digital age.   \n\nWith online threats growing daily, relying solely on slow-moving regulations is insufficient. Individuals must take the initiative to understand and control their own privacy. This self-reliance, combined with targeted laws against abuse, offers the best path forward. The issue is simply too vital and complex for governmental oversight alone. Engaged citizens committed to safeguarding their own privacy remain our best defense.",
