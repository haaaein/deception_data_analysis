A study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that drug importation could save Americans up to $6.5 billion per year on their medication costs. This would be a game-changer for families living paycheck-to-paycheck and seniors on fixed incomes, who are often forced to ration or skip their medications due to unaffordable prices.\n\nConcerns over drug safety and quality can be effectively addressed through robust regulatory frameworks. Many countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, have well-established processes to ensure the safety and efficacy of imported drugs. By partnering with these countries and implementing stringent oversight, we can guarantee that imported medications meet the same high standards as those sold domestically. Additionally, studies have shown that the risk of counterfeit or substandard drugs entering the supply chain through importation is extremely low, especially when compared to the hazards posed by the current system.\n\nThe time has come to put the well-being of patients first and take bold action to lower prescription drug prices. By enabling the safe importation of medications, we can improve access to essential medicines and provide much-needed relief to millions of Americans struggling with the high cost of healthcare. This is a win-win solution that we can no longer afford to ignore.",

Denying access threatens their ability to fully participate in civil society. \n\nAdditionally, identity verification systems are highly prone to bias and error, disproportionately harming women, minorities and other groups. Algorithmic systems trained on limited datasets often fail for those outside the mainstream. Forcing people into narrow, prescribed categories just further entrenches systemic inequities.\n\nRather than identity checks, social media companies should empower users with tools to manage their own privacy and security. Features like strong encryption, two-factor authentication and robust block/filter options allow people to control their experience.

While verifying identities may seem beneficial on the surface, the costs and risks far outweigh any potential benefits. \n\nRequiring identity verification would threaten user privacy and security. Social media users have valid reasons for wanting anonymity or pseudonymity, from protecting against stalkers to avoiding employer discrimination. Forcing people to reveal personal details would expose them to significant risks. Even \"verified\" systems can leak confidential data. \n\nMandating identity checks would also exclude vulnerable groups who lack official documentation, like undocumented immigrants, political dissidents and homeless youth.

Denying access threatens their ability to fully participate in civil society. \n\nAdditionally, identity verification systems are highly prone to bias and error, disproportionately harming women, minorities and other groups. Algorithmic systems trained on limited datasets often fail for those outside the mainstream. Forcing people into narrow, prescribed categories just further entrenches systemic inequities.\n\nRather than identity checks, social media companies should empower users with tools to manage their own privacy and security. Features like strong encryption, two-factor authentication and robust block/filter options allow people to control their experience. Together with community standards, content moderation and law enforcement cooperation, social media can combat harmful actors without compromising user rights and freedoms.
