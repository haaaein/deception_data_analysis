When people see an ad about a condition they suffer from, it prompts them to do their own research and discuss potential treatment options with their physician. This exchange allows doctors to properly assess each patient's symptoms and medical history to determine the best course of action. Banning these ads would deny patients access to knowledge about conditions and latest treatment innovations. It also gives pharmaceutical companies economic incentive to invest in developing new drugs that could alleviate pain and suffering. A comprehensive review by the Food and Drug Administration found that risks of overprescription are relatively low because physicians still make independent judgments based on individual patient needs. If any issues do arise, less restrictive measures than an outright ban, like improved disclaimers, could help address them. Overall, the benefits of informed patients and progress against illness outweigh the limited risks, so prescription drug commercials should be permitted on television.",

        "claim": "Drug importation jeopardizes safety controls and the domestic pharma industry.",
        "argument": "There are many reasons why importing drugs from other countries is dangerous and threatens our domestic pharmaceutical industry. Allowing unchecked importation of drugs will undermine the stringent safety regulations and quality controls that the FDA imposes on drugs produced for U.S. markets. According to studies from the Pew Charitable Trusts, up to 8% of imported drugs are counterfeit and fail safety standards, and some contain dangerous contaminants or incorrect doses that put patients at risk.\n\nPermitting drug importation will also severely impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry by incentivizing companies to move manufacturing overseas to take advantage of lax regulations and cheaper labor costs. This could result in the loss of over 100,000 high-paying jobs in the U.S. and reduce investments in R&D for new innovative treatments. A report by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America found that for every $1 million in lost revenue from importation, nearly 5 high-skilled jobs will be cut. \n\nWhile proponents argue that allowing importation will reduce drug costs, there is little evidence to support this. In fact, according to analyses by the CBO, importation would only reduce costs for consumers by at most 1% while threatening public health and harming domestic pharmaceutical companies that depend on U.S. sales to fund research into lifesaving new medicines. \n\nIn summary, drug importation should not be permitted because it will undermine safety controls, threaten jobs, reduce investments in innovation, and not substantially decrease costs. The risks to public health, the economy and the future of medicine far outweigh any dubious benefits. Our current closed system helps ensure quality, supports an industry that saves lives, and protects patients. We must oppose any policy that puts profits over patients and scientific progress.",

According to data from Sustainalytics, over 80% of major companies have already committed to cutting emissions or using renewable energy without being forced to do so.
