By learning about chronic conditions they may have, and about treatment options available to them, people can make informed decisions in collaboration with their doctors to find the option that is right for them. According to a recent study, over 60% of people who have seen prescription drug ads on TV have consulted their doctor about advertised medications, highlighting the positive impact of ads in facilitating productive doctor-patient conversations.\n\nPrescription drug ads also fill an information gap, especially for underserved populations with less access to healthcare. For many illnesses, stigma and lack of public awareness prevent people from seeking treatment. When prescription drug ads highlight treatable conditions like depression, erectile dysfunction or incontinence, they help normalize these issues and encourage sufferers to speak to their doctors about options they may not have known existed.  \n\nWhile critics argue that ads may promote overprescription of expensive drugs, multiple studies have found little evidence to support this concern. In fact, data shows that areas of the US that allow prescription drug ads have similar or even lower levels of opioid use and spending on prescription drugs overall compared to areas without ads. \n\nIn summary, prescription drug ads on TV empower consumers and bridge access gaps in the healthcare system. By promoting awareness and doctor-patient conversations about medical conditions and treatment options, these ads have the potential to benefit public health. For these reasons, prescription drug advertising should be broadly allowed and encouraged.",

        "argument": "Requiring companies to disclose their climate impacts  will hamper innovation and economic growth. Burdensome regulations force businesses to divert resources away from developing new products and services, instead using them to comply with bureaucratic red tape. With companies focused on filling out government forms, they have less ability to invest in the research and development that drives progress.  \n\nMandatory climate disclosures are based on dubious science and will mislead consumers. The models used to calculate companies’ carbon footprints are imperfect and fail to account for many complex factors. Shoppers will make misguided choices based on inaccurate information, which distorts the free market. Until the science of climate change impact measurement improves, these disclosures will do more harm than good.  \n\nNew regulations threaten jobs and raise costs for consumers. When companies face higher costs due to government mandates, they often have to cut costs elsewhere—like reducing staff or increasing prices. Thousands of workers could lose their jobs and people will pay more for goods and services. In today’s troubled economy, we cannot afford policies that hamper businesses’ ability to rebound or add financial stress to households.  \n\nClimate change is a global issue, so unilateral action is meaningless. Even if policies could reduce emissions for U.S. companies, other nations must act in concert for there to be a meaningful solution. Until there are binding international agreements, subjecting only American firms to these burdensome rules will not make a difference on climate change and only serves to disadvantage U.S. businesses relative to their foreign competitors. \n\nIn summary, mandatory climate impact disclosures for corporations are misguided policies that threaten innovation, jobs, and economic growth while increasing costs for consumers—all without actually helping to solve the problem of climate change. They should not be required.",

Recent studies estimate that as much as 20% of welfare spending is lost to some form of fraud or abuse each year. That amounts to billions of dollars being wasted or misused.\n\nBy implementing modest tracking measures for welfare recipients, we can curb this abuse and instead direct more funds toward genuinely helping those facing hardship. Tracking need not involve invasive surveillance - simple periodic check-ins and reviews of basic eligibility criteria could go a long way. For example, verifying continued residence and living situation helps confirm funds are reaching those truly without means or options. \n\nWith increased accountability and oversight, we can regain public trust that the system is not being taken advantage of. And with wasted funds diverted back to serving citizens in need, more families may receive the assistance available to them. Tracking is a reasonable step to balance compassion with fiscal responsibility. Ultimately, it protects the benefits of those who depend on them the most through no fault of their own. Our system should support the vulnerable, not enable abuse of scarce public resources.",

        "claim": "Social media platforms should be liable for harmful content posted by users",
        "argument": "Social media platforms can no longer abdicate responsibility for the content posted by users on their platforms. While some content moderation currently exists, social media companies still allow harmful, unethical, dangerous and illegal content to proliferate on their platforms, negatively impacting society. \n\nA recent study found that over 60% of parents worry their child will see inappropriate content on social media, and over 30% of teens have experienced cyberbullying on social media platforms. According to mental health experts, increased social media use correlates with rising rates of anxiety, depression and loneliness, especially in teens and young adults. By failing to properly moderate content, social media companies are complicit in these harms.\n\nCritics argue that social media companies are simply platforms, and should not be liable for user-generated content. However, these companies curate content and use algorithms to actively promote and spread content - they are not neutral. They profit greatly from keeping users engaged, even with inappropriate content. It is unjust for companies to benefit financially from content that hurts society.  \n\nSocial media has enormous power and influence, and with that comes responsibility. Regulations are needed to force companies into taking content moderation seriously and being proactive about removing harmful posts. Fines for violations and legal liability would incentivize companies to make ethical content moderation a priority. Overall, social media platforms must be held accountable for harmful content on their platforms in order to curb damaging real-world effects and build a healthy online community.",
