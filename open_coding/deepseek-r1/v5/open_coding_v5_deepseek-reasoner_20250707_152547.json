By implementing a system of user identity verification, we can address these pressing concerns and create a safer, more accountable online environment.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of verifying user identities on social media is the ability to hold individuals accountable for their actions.

Coaches are paid exorbitant multi-million dollar salaries while the student-athletes who are the heart and soul of these sports get nothing beyond their scholarships and small stipends. A 2022 study found the average Division 1 men's basketball player is worth over $300,000 per year while a football player is worth nearly $200,000 to their school. Paying each athlete even a $50,000 salary would be a drop in the bucket compared to the value they generate.\n\nWhat's more, paying college athletes would help many from underprivileged backgrounds support themselves and their families. For athletes who come from poor families, sending money home from a salary could be life-changing. It would also lessen the temptation for athletes to accept illegal payments or gifts under the table from boosters and agents.\n\nLastly, schools could fund modest athlete salaries by cutting excessive spending in other areas, such as coaches' salaries.

Experts predict importation would lead to significant American job losses. As imported cut-rate drugs flood the market, U.S. drug companies would be forced to slash investment in research for new cures. As a result, medical innovation would slow to a trickle, depriving millions of promising new therapies.\n\nFor the safety of patients and the future of American pharmaceutical innovation, the risks of drug importation are too high.
