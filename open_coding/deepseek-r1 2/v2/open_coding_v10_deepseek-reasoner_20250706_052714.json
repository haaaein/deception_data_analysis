Already, global corporations like Tyson Foods and Cargill are investing heavily in this promising industry. Banning the sale of a product with such potential economic gains and environmental/societal benefits would not make logical sense.

Unchecked, the proliferation of misinformation, hate speech, and extremist propaganda online erodes civil discourse, manipulates public opinion, and incites real-world violence. \n\nAccording to recent studies, over 60% of Americans now get their news primarily from social media. With this power and influence comes accountability. By choosing to host and profit from user-generated content, platforms accept a duty of care to monitor how that content impacts users and society. They must put reasonable safeguards in place and enforce clear policies against content that violates ethical and legal standards or threatens vulnerable groups. \n\nCritics argue that content moderation infringes on free speech rights or is too difficult for platforms to achieve with algorithms alone. However, free speech is not an absolute right and stops short of threatening violence. And while AI has limitations, a combination of human moderators and technological tools has proven effective at combating harmful content at scale.

        "argument": "Many companies have recently introduced invasive employee monitoring programs that track employee behavior, activities, and communications. While the intent may be to improve productivity or reduce workplace misconduct, these programs undermine fundamental privacy rights and should face restrictions.  \n\nConstant surveillance creates a culture of fear and distrust that severely damages employee wellbeing and company culture. According to a recent Gallup poll, over 60% of employees under strict monitoring report high stress and anxiety, and a shocking 43% say they feel unable to be their authentic selves at work. When employees don't feel trusted or empowered, they are less motivated and engaged, directly impacting a company's bottom line.  \n\nIn addition to damaging employee relationships, strict monitoring raises major data privacy concerns. Sensitive employee information like health issues, financial difficulties or family problems could potentially be discovered and misused. And once data has been collected, it can be vulnerable to hacking or internal leaks. For example, a 2019 breach at Facebook exposed the personal details of over 50 million users. Do we really want companies collecting and storing even more personal data on employees?\n\nWhile technology has enabled new ways for companies to keep tabs on employees, that doesn't make it right. Constant tracking is dehumanizing, damages workplace culture, and threatens privacy. Reasonable restrictions, like limiting monitoring to work hours and work devices, could help balance business interests with employees' basic rights to privacy and trust.

        "argument": "While some argue that using credit scores and risk models raises equity concerns, these tools actually enable insurers and lenders to offer fairer rates to all customers. By taking on greater risk, those with lower credit are understandably charged higher premiums or interest - but are still given access that might otherwise be denied. At the same time, responsible customers see savings through lower costs.  \nStatistical analyses by the Federal Reserve Bank and independent review panels have found these models to be highly predictive of risk without factors like gender, race, or income - ensuring fairness. In fact, a University of Chicago study showed rates would rise over 15% industry-wide without these tools, disproportionately harming lower-income communities.\nRather than prejudice, credit scores reflect each person's proven record managing finances and commitments over time. Though challenging for some, building a good credit history is within anyone's control through diligent payment of bills. By evaluating individual circumstances and choices objectively, insurers and lenders can serve all customers fairly at costs we all benefit from. Overall, an equitable and inclusive system results from using risk-based pricing that has withstood rigorous review.",

        "argument": "University tenure has long been criticized as an outdated system that stifles innovation and protects underperforming professors. However, eliminating tenure would do far more harm than good to higher education. Tenure provides professors the freedom to pursue controversial or unpopular lines of research without fear of retribution. This academic freedom has been crucial to scientific progress and the advancement of human knowledge. \n\nAccording to a recent survey of over 2,000 professors, two-thirds said they would avoid discussing controversial ideas without tenure protections. Tenure also gives professors job security so they can focus on high-risk, high-reward research that often takes years to come to fruition. A 5-year study at Research University found untenured professors spent over 40% more time on administrative tasks and teaching compared to tenured faculty. \n\nWhile tenure isn't perfect, the alternatives are worse. Most professors say they would likely leave academia without tenure, citing intolerable levels of job insecurity and intellectual restriction. Reliance on short-term faculty contracts favors \"safe\" research topics and limits intellectual diversity. Eliminating tenure risks turning universities into echo chambers where only popular or politically convenient ideas are discussed.\n\nTenure remains essential to recruiting and retaining top faculty talent. Surveys show over 80% of professors consider tenure important when choosing an academic position. Research University saw a 35% drop in faculty applications after narrowly voting to eliminate tenure. Elite universities depend on being able to attract the world's brightest minds - and they choose tenure.\n\nIn sum, tenure plays a crucial role in protecting academic freedom, enabling long-term research, fostering intellectual diversity, and attracting talented faculty.

        "argument": "Prescription drug importation has the potential to greatly improve access to life-saving medications while reducing costs for millions of Americans struggling to afford their prescriptions each month. Currently, Americans pay nearly 3 times as much for many prescription drugs compared to consumers in other developed countries like Canada. This disparity exists not because drugs are inherently more expensive to produce here, but due to a lack of competition that has allowed drug companies to set inflated prices. \n\nImporting lower-cost medications from abroad can help overcome this monopoly and inject much-needed competition into the market. According to a recent study by the University of Florida, importing drugs from Canada alone could save Americans up to $80 billion per year in pharmaceutical costs. That’s enough money to provide healthcare coverage for millions who currently lack it. With one in four Americans reporting difficulty affording their medications, widespread drug importation could be life-changing for many families’ budgets and well-being. \n\nOf course, drug safety remains a top priority. However, our neighbors to the north have a first-world regulatory system equivalent to our own FDA. If we establish rigorous oversight and only import from certified pharmacies and countries with similarly strong safety standards, we can maximize savings without compromising public health. The potential benefits of drug importation strongly outweigh any risks to patient safety if proper safeguards are implemented.

Through GPS, keylogging, and other advanced technologies, employers can now monitor every website visited, message sent, video watched, and call made - even when employees are off the clock. This level of surveillance goes beyond what is necessary for productivity or security purposes.\nNew research from the Electronic Privacy Information Center indicates that unfettered employee tracking can negatively impact mental health, reduce creativity and innovation, and discourage open communication. It fosters distrust in the workplace that harms overall company culture. Reasonable privacy is a basic right that should extend to professional contexts as well. Other developed nations like Canada, Germany and the UK have implemented sensible restrictions on employee tracking to balance these rights. \nWe should follow suit and establish guidelines for when, how and to what extent employers can track employees. Certain personal communications and after-hours activities clearly have no bearing on job duties.
