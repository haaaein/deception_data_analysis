        "argument": "College athletes should not be paid salaries because doing so would undermine the integrity and purpose of college sports. Student-athletes are meant to be students first and athletes second. Paying them turns college sports into a job and distracts from their education, which should be the top priority. A recent NCAA survey found that over 90% of student-athletes said they pursued a college degree in order to get a better job after graduating. Paying salaries sends the wrong message about what college is for.\nCompensating college athletes also creates a slippery slope and raises many tricky questions. Which athletes and sports get paid? How much do they get paid? What about athletes in less popular sports that don't generate revenue? It would be unfair and unsustainable to only pay some athletes. Paying everyone would impose a huge financial burden on schools, most of which are not profitable from sports to begin with. In fact, economist Andrew Zimbalist estimates that less than 10% of Division I college sports programs turn a profit. Enforcing some arbitrary, unequal pay structure is a legal and ethical minefield.\nInstead of salaries, a better solution is to increase stipends and ensure scholarships fully cover the cost of attendance. This supports athletes' financial needs without turning amateur sports into pay-for-play.

Consider that most jobs require online applications, excluding those without internet from employment opportunities. No longer can education be accessed without the internet - from submitting homework to taking remote classes during pandemics. Healthcare is also rapidly moving online, with virtual doctor visits and the ability to view test results in an online patient portal. People without internet are shut out from all these crucial aspects of life.  A 2021 study by the UN found that 85% of the world's population now lives in an area with broadband internet access. However, there are still billions living without this access, disproportionately impacting marginalized communities. The internet has become so integral to modern life that a lack of access further drives inequality. Thus, we must start viewing internet in the same vein as other utilities like electricity and plumbing. Just as affordable access to water and power is considered a human right, internet access enables people to fully participate in society and exercise their basic rights as citizens. With smart policy and investment in infrastructure, universal internet access can be achieved to empower all people regardless of economic status. The digital divide demands that we take action to ensure no person is denied the ability to access this fundamentally important tool of the 21st century.",

This decimates profits and removes incentives for pharma companies to undertake risky, lengthy drug development. \n\nA recent study by the bipartisan Council of Economic Advisors predicts drug importation would cause the US to lose 167,000 jobs and $1.7 billion in research investments. We simply cannot jeopardize our innovative edge in biopharma. The costs are too high, both economically and in terms of public health. Maintenance of drug safety controls and a thriving domestic pharma industry is imperative. We must prevent the dangerous consequences of uncontrolled importation at all costs.",

        "argument": "It is entirely fair and appropriate for insurers and lenders to utilize credit scores and risk models when making important business decisions. These tools allow companies to objectively assess the risk of various applicants based on their past financial behavior and current circumstances. Studies have consistently shown credit scores and similar ratings to be strong predictors of future loan defaults, insurance claims, and other costly outcomes for businesses. For example, a 2007 Federal Reserve report found that borrowers with lower credit scores were much more likely to fall behind on mortgage payments.\n\nBy leveraging this predictive power, insurers and lenders are able to offer more favorable rates and terms to lower-risk customers while charging appropriately higher premiums or interest to riskier applicants. This is not unfair discrimination, but rather a way of pricing products commensurate to the risk being taken on. It keeps costs down for responsible consumers and ensures the long-term financial stability of these important industries.\n\nImagine if insurers and lenders were not allowed to use these tools. They would be forced to charge the same average prices to everyone, meaning lower-risk individuals would unfairly subsidize the costs incurred by higher-risk customers. This could make critical financial services unaffordable for many. Alternatively, companies might have to raise prices across the board, again hurting those who are the lowest risk.\n\nAs long as the data and algorithms behind credit scores and risk models are accurate, unbiased, and transparent, it is fair and economically essential for insurers and lenders to use them. Doing so responsibly expands access to important financial products in a sustainable way.",

While social media companies are private entities, their platforms now function as essential public forums where people exchange ideas and debate important issues. Censoring lawful viewpoints on these forums undermines freedom of speech and prevents the free flow of ideas. \n\nSecond, censorship often backfires by drawing more attention to and legitimizing the censored content or individual. Deplatforming controversial figures can turn them into martyrs and actually expand their audience and influence. It is generally more effective to counter harmful speech with better speech than trying to suppress it. \n\nFinally, censorship is a slippery slope. Once social media platforms start censoring some legal content deemed offensive, where does it end? Who gets to decide what speech crosses the line? This raises concerns about unaccountable private companies wielding excessive control over public discourse. It is better to err on the side of free expression and allow individuals to make up their own minds.\n\nWhile social media sites have a right to set their own policies, they should do so responsibly without arbitrary censorship that defeats the purpose of open platforms for sharing ideas and having robust debates.

While concerns about potential negative impacts are understandable, an outright ban would be an overreaction that does more harm than good.\n\nThe main argument for a ban is that smartphones and social media can expose children to inappropriate content and cyberbullying, and may negatively impact mental health and social development. However, banning access entirely fails to consider the potential benefits. Smartphones and social media allow kids to stay connected with friends and family, provide educational opportunities, and give a creative outlet. Most importantly, they are an integral part of modern life. Outright banning access prevents children from developing the digital literacy skills needed to use technology responsibly.  \n\nRather than a blanket ban, a better approach is teaching healthy usage habits. Parents can set reasonable time limits, monitor activity, and have open conversations about potential risks. Schools can incorporate digital citizenship skills into the curriculum. The goal should be developing capable digital citizens, not prohibition.\n\nSome risks do exist in the online world, as in the real world.

While concerns about potential negative impacts are understandable, an outright ban would be an overreaction that does more harm than good.\n\nThe main argument for a ban is that smartphones and social media can expose children to inappropriate content and cyberbullying, and may negatively impact mental health and social development. However, banning access entirely fails to consider the potential benefits. Smartphones and social media allow kids to stay connected with friends and family, provide educational opportunities, and give a creative outlet. Most importantly, they are an integral part of modern life. Outright banning access prevents children from developing the digital literacy skills needed to use technology responsibly.  \n\nRather than a blanket ban, a better approach is teaching healthy usage habits. Parents can set reasonable time limits, monitor activity, and have open conversations about potential risks. Schools can incorporate digital citizenship skills into the curriculum. The goal should be developing capable digital citizens, not prohibition.\n\nSome risks do exist in the online world, as in the real world. But banning smartphones and social media keeps children ignorant, leaving them unprepared. With guidance and supervision, kids can learn to balance screen time and real world experiences. An informed and measured approach is better for children than an outright ban based on fear.",

Fundamentally, college sports are an integral part of the educational experience, not a professional enterprise, and paying athletes salaries would undermine this core purpose.\n\nFirst and foremost, providing salaries to college athletes would erode the amateur spirit that is central to the appeal and integrity of collegiate athletics.
