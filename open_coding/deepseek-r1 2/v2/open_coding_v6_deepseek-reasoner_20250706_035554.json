        "argument": "Currently, billionaires and private spaceflight companies are pushing to send the first crewed missions to Mars in the next decade. But while reaching the Red Planet would be a tremendous achievement, we must remember that Mars is an unforgiving and potentially deadly environment that we still don't fully understand.\nEarly Mars settlers would face constant dangers including space radiation, toxic soil, cosmic rays, microgravity effects, extreme isolation, and limited food, water, and medical supplies. According to a study by MIT researchers, even if a Mars base was established, more than half of the initial colonists would likely perish within the first year.\nWhile some argue that Mars explorers will accept the high risks in the name of exploration and adventure, as a society we still have a moral duty to keep these brave pioneers as safe as possible. Just like with medical research trials, we need to establish acceptable risk thresholds for initial Mars missions - perhaps no more than a 10% chance of death or serious injury.\nWith clear risk limits in place, it will force the space industry to take the necessary time to further study Mars conditions, develop safer habitats and protective equipment, and establish robust supply chains and rescue capabilities before embarking on the first human missions. We should take a cautious approach - while still moving forward with Mars exploration plans - to give our first interplanetary ambassadors the highest possible odds of survival and success. Establishing risk limits will help pave the way for a safer and more sustainable human presence on Mars.",

        "argument": "In today's digital age, smartphones and social media have become ubiquitous in the lives of young people. While these technologies offer many benefits, there is a growing body of evidence that their overuse can have detrimental effects on the physical, mental, and social well-being of children and adolescents. As such, a case can be made that smartphones and social media should be banned for kids under the age of 16.\n\nFirstly, numerous studies have shown that excessive screen time and social media use can lead to a range of physical health problems in young people, including obesity, sleep deprivation, and eye strain. For example, a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that children who spent more than two hours per day on digital devices were 2.5 times more likely to be overweight or obese compared to their peers who spent less than one hour per day on these devices.\n\nAdditionally, research has demonstrated that social media use can have significant negative impacts on mental health, particularly for adolescents. A 2019 study conducted by the Royal Society for Public Health found that social media use was linked to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality among young people. Furthermore, studies have shown that social media can contribute to feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and cyberbullying, all of which can have serious consequences for the well-being of young people.\n\nFinally, there is growing concern that the constant use of smartphones and social media is negatively impacting the social development and communication skills of children and adolescents.

Tenure ensures professors can pursue controversial ideas and academic topics free from undue influence. Without tenure, professors could face backlash for researching or teaching unpopular topics. This academic freedom has led to groundbreaking discoveries and insights in every discipline that improve people's lives. \n\nReforming or eliminating tenure would stifle creativity and innovation in academia. Professors would avoid tackling difficult or sensitive topics if their job security depended more on popularity than scholarly merit. Academics need protections to pursue truths and share knowledge, even if it challenges the status quo. Tenure provides that protection.\n\nTenure also attracts talent to academia and retains expert scholars who would otherwise leave for industry. Top researchers want assurances their work environment will remain intellectually open and insulated from political pressure.

Currently, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour has not been increased since 2009 and has failed to keep pace with the rising cost of living. A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that a living wage for a single adult in the United States is $16.54 per hour, and for a single parent with one child, it is $34.48 per hour. At the current federal minimum wage, a full-time worker earns just $15,080 per year, which is well below the federal poverty line for a family of two.\n\nIncreasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour would lift millions of American workers out of poverty and provide them with the means to afford housing, food, healthcare, and other basic necessities. This, in turn, would have a ripple effect on the economy, as these workers would have more disposable income to spend on goods and services, driving economic growth and job creation. Furthermore, research has shown that higher minimum wages lead to improved health outcomes, reduced reliance on public assistance programs, and increased worker productivity.\n\nWhile opponents may argue that a higher minimum wage will lead to job losses, multiple studies have found that moderate increases in the minimum wage have little to no effect on employment levels.

        "argument": "Genetic engineering of unborn babies to eliminate disease should be allowed because it has the potential to prevent immense suffering. Many debilitating and even fatal diseases like cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, and sickle cell anemia are caused by single genetic mutations that could be corrected before birth through gene editing techniques like CRISPR. \n\nA common counterargument is that genetic engineering is unnatural and interferes with nature's course. However, parents already make choices to improve their children's lives, whether through better nutrition, education, or medical care. Correcting a genetic mutation is no different than correcting any other medical condition. In fact, gene editing may be more ethical because it can prevent suffering before it even begins. \n\nSome express concerns about unknown risks, but all medical advances initially carry uncertainties. With rigorous scientific research and responsible implementation, risks can be minimized. Gene editing has already proven effective and safe in clinical trials for other applications. Preventing terrible diseases far outweighs any hypothetical risks.\n\nCritics also worry about a slippery slope, where parents demand genetic enhancements beyond just eliminating disease. However, public policy can allow therapeutic applications while prohibiting enhancement. Thoughtful regulations will enable great benefits while preventing misuse.  \n\nIn the end, parents have a moral imperative to provide their children the best life possible. If a simple gene edit can prevent a lifetime of pain and hardship, without significant risks, then we have an obligation to allow it. Eliminating disease through genetic engineering upholds fundamental human rights and human dignity. With proper oversight, it can change lives for the better.",

While the intention behind these models may be to provide a standardized and objective metric, the reality is that they are inherently discriminatory and perpetuate systemic biases.\n\nFirstly, credit scoring models are heavily influenced by factors that are beyond an individual's control, such as their socioeconomic background, race, and gender. Studies have shown that these demographic factors are often strongly correlated with credit scores, even when controlling for financial behavior. For example, a 2015 study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that African-American and Hispanic consumers were more likely to have lower credit scores than their white counterparts, despite having similar credit histories and financial profiles.\n\nMoreover, the data used to build these models is often skewed and incomplete, failing to capture the nuances of an individual's financial situation. Many low-income and marginalized communities have limited access to traditional financial services, resulting in thin or non-existent credit histories.
