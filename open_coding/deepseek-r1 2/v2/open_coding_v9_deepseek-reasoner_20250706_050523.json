These unforeseen effects could create a vicious cycle of ever more extreme interventions to correct the problems created.  \n\nFurthermore, geoengineering technologies require extensive testing to understand their impacts but our climate system is incredibly complex. We do not have a “backup planet” to experiment on to ensure these techniques are safe before deploying them on a large scale. For all we know, geoengineering could make the climate situation even worse.\n\nRather than resorting to risky geoengineering, we must cut carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy as quickly as possible. Curbing pollution at its source is the only safe, sustainable solution to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Geoengineering is not worth the gamble – our planet depends on us choosing proven, responsible action over dubious techno-fixes.

        "argument": "Social media has become central to public discourse and the sharing of information. However, advances in AI have made it possible to generate highly realistic but fabricated images, videos, and text that could deceive users and undermine truth. Requiring social media companies to clearly label AI-generated content would help address this threat through transparency.\nResearch shows that unlabeled synthetic media is often mistaken as authentic by many users. As Deepfakes and other manipulated media become more sophisticated, it will become increasingly difficult for average people to distinguish real from fake without some indication. This could allow the intentional spread of misinformation to influence opinions and events. \nHowever, simply labeling AI content will not unduly limit free expression or create burdensome oversight. It merely provides users with important context to critically evaluate what they see online. Major platforms already moderate obscene or dangerous material, so adding a simple flag for AI-generated posts would be a reasonable extension to maintain the integrity and trust of their services.  \nOverall, transparently labeling synthetic media will empower social media users to be informed participants in public debates. It can help curb the abuse of AI for deception while not infringing on free speech. In an age of deepfakes, some form of indication for AI-generated content has become necessary to preserve the credibility of online information and discussion.",
