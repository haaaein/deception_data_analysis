However, charter schools provide an innovative solution that is expanding educational opportunities and driving real change. Studies have shown that charter schools are closing achievement gaps, with students from disadvantaged backgrounds demonstrating especially strong results (Center for Research on Education Outcomes, 2020). By freeing educators from bureaucratic restrictions, charter schools can tailor curriculums and teach methods that engage students in new and inspiring ways. They also empower parents to choose learning environments that best suit their children. \n\nWith increased public school funding yet stagnant test scores, it's clear that major reforms are needed. Charter schools provide healthy competition that motivates all schools to improve. In cities with more charter school options, public school students are benefiting from renewed focus on quality (National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, 2018).

        "argument": "We should aggressively pursue climate geoengineering research as an insurance policy against catastrophic climate change. The effects of runaway climate change pose an existential threat if left unaddressed, with consequences that would reshape life as we know it. While mitigation efforts focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions are critical, the pace of progress has been far too slow given the scale of this crisis. \nClimate geoengineering techniques like solar radiation management could serve as a tool of last resort, buying critical time to accelerate transitioning to carbon neutral energy and transportation systems. Initial research suggests solar geoengineering could offset temperature rise at a fraction of the cost of mitigation, according to studies from Harvard and elsewhere. While far from a silver bullet solution, geoengineering deserves serious investigation as part of a comprehensive strategy that combines mitigation, adaptation, and technology.\nCritics argue that geoengineering is too risky and could have unforeseen consequences, but regulated, carefully monitored research is the only way to properly assess the viability and risks of different approaches. Some level of risk is inherent in any solution at the scale required to address climate change. With strong governance and oversight, geoengineering could be deployed in a manner that balances risk and reward. The fact is we have only begun to scratch the surface of geoengineering's potential, and further research may uncover approaches with fewer downsides and hazards.\nIn summary, the threat of cataclysmic climate change demands that we keep all options on the table. While geoengineering is not a substitute for emission reductions, it could buy time and safety margins that mitigation alone may fail to provide. We owe it to future generations to fully explore any and all means of overcoming this crisis. Climate geoengineering research should be pursued to ensure that we have exhausted all possibilities before accepting unavoidable catastrophe.",

        "claim": "Social media platforms should not be liable for harmful content posted by users",
        "argument": "Social media platforms should not be held liable for harmful content posted by individual users. Holding tech companies responsible for billions of daily user posts and comments is unrealistic and sets a dangerous precedent. \n\nAccording to a recent study, over 4.5 billion pieces of content are shared on social media every day. It is simply not feasible for platforms to monitor and moderate all of that content in real time. Despite investing heavily in content moderation, harmful posts will inevitably slip through the cracks. We cannot reasonably expect tech companies to achieve a 100% success rate at scale.\n\nIf we establish that platforms are liable for user-generated content, it will discourage innovation and limit free expression. Companies will adopt overzealous content moderation policies out of fear of legal punishment, removing harmless posts and stifling open debate. They may avoid launching new features over liability concerns. Individual users may censor themselves rather than risk a platform's wrath. \n\nFinally, ultimately individuals are responsible for their own speech. If a user posts hateful, unethical or illegal content, they should face consequences - not the platform they used. Platforms provide tools for communication and connection; they do not dictate how individuals choose to use those tools. Holding platforms liable for user actions both misplaces responsibility and excuses the real perpetrators of harmful speech.\n\nIn summary, imposing liability on social media companies for user-generated content is impractical, threatens open expression and innovation, and excuses individuals from responsibility for their own harmful speech. Social media platforms should not face legal punishment for content posted by users. The solution lies in individuals using platforms responsibly, not in stifling tech companies' abilities to operate and connect people around the world.",

Tenure is essential for protecting academic freedom and encouraging innovative research and teaching. Without tenure, professors may avoid researching or teaching about controversial topics for fear of backlash or job loss. This could significantly hamper the search for truth and new ideas. \n\nStudies have also found that tenured professors overall produce higher-quality research over their careers compared to non-tenured professors. The job security of tenure allows professors to take on longer-term or riskier research projects that push boundaries without worrying as much about short-term outcomes or pressures. This benefits society by advancing our understanding over the long run.\n\nWhile some argue tenure rewards mediocrity, the facts show otherwise. According to a survey of over 10,000 professors, more than 80% of tenured professors feel their recent review processes maintain high standards of excellence in research and teaching. Switching to short-term contracts could discourage professors from improving throughout their careers. \n\nOverall, tenure has helped make universities worldwide engines of innovation for centuries by protecting important values like academic freedom. With some minor updates, this balanced system can continue supporting rigorous and impactful research as well as first-rate education critical to solving society's most pressing problems.",

Direct-to-consumer advertising promotes overprescription and misleads consumers about medication risks and benefits. According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, patients who discussed advertised drugs with their doctors were more likely to request those brand-name medications, even if cheaper generic alternatives were available.  \n\nThis results in billions spent unnecessarily each year on new prescriptions that may not be medically necessary or the best treatment option. For example, the drugs Nexium and Prilosec have nearly identical composition and uses, yet Nexium has been heavily marketed directly to consumers despite costing much more. Allowing ads also incentivizes pharmaceutical companies to lobby doctors to prioritize prescribing revenue-generating brand names over less advertised but potentially safer or more effective generic alternatives.\n\nMost other developed nations have long prohibited these ads, recognizing that the doctor-patient relationship and public health are better served when medical decisions are based on treatment needs rather than commercial interests. For public health and fiscal responsibility, television drug marketing should end to prevent overprescription of unnecessary or more expensive brand-name medications.",

Automakers are rapidly improving autonomous vehicle technology with the goal of making our roads much safer. Within the next decade, fully autonomous vehicles without steering wheels or pedals could become commonplace. This would save thousands of lives each year in the United States alone.\n\nAccording to a recent study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, over 90% of car crashes are caused by human error such as distracted driving, drunken driving, or fatigue.
