For example, a 2007 Federal Reserve report found that borrowers with lower credit scores were much more likely to fall behind on mortgage payments.\n\nBy leveraging this predictive power, insurers and lenders are able to offer more favorable rates and terms to lower-risk customers while charging appropriately higher premiums or interest to riskier applicants. This is not unfair discrimination, but rather a way of pricing products commensurate to the risk being taken on. It keeps costs down for responsible consumers and ensures the long-term financial stability of these important industries.\n\nImagine if insurers and lenders were not allowed to use these tools. They would be forced to charge the same average prices to everyone, meaning lower-risk individuals would unfairly subsidize the costs incurred by higher-risk customers. This could make critical financial services unaffordable for many. Alternatively, companies might have to raise prices across the board, again hurting those who are the lowest risk.\n\nAs long as the data and algorithms behind credit scores and risk models are accurate, unbiased, and transparent, it is fair and economically essential for insurers and lenders to use them. Doing so responsibly expands access to important financial products in a sustainable way.",

While the pharmaceutical industry claims that these ads empower patients and promote disease awareness, the reality is that they pose significant risks to public health and should be banned from television.\n\nOne of the primary issues with prescription drug ads is that they frequently downplay or gloss over the potential side effects and risks associated with these medications. The fast-paced, visually appealing nature of these ads often overshadows the fine print disclaimers, leading viewers to underestimate the dangers. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that over 60% of prescription drug ads fail to adequately convey the risks and side effects of the medications they promote.\n\nFurthermore, these ads have been shown to drive up healthcare costs by encouraging patients to request brand-name drugs, even when generic or alternative treatments may be more appropriate and affordable. A report by the National Institutes of Health estimated that direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs increases overall healthcare spending by $30 billion per year in the United States alone.\n\nUltimately, the potential harms of prescription drug ads on television outweigh any purported benefits. By banning these ads, we can protect public health, promote more responsible and ethical pharmaceutical marketing practices, and reduce the financial burden on the healthcare system. For these reasons, prescription drug ads should no longer be allowed on television.",
