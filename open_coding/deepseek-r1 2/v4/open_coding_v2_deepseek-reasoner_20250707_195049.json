We should permit reasonable testing and iteration within acceptable margins of risk. With time and experience, safety practices will coalesce around optimal standards. Imposing overly burdensome rules prematurely could delay or derail our progress toward affordable, safe and routine access to space for all. The potential upside for humanity is immense - inspiring a new generation toward space, opening up space-based research, perhaps enabling colonization of other worlds someday. We cannot allow small-minded fear of reasonable risk to limit our horizons.\n\nThe time has come to open access to space for more than just highly-trained government astronauts. Space tourism promises a new era that could ignite our imaginations and change the trajectory of our species. But this requires accepting necessary risks. With proper precautions and a bold but balanced approach, space tourism can develop both responsibly and rapidly. The potential reward is no less than reigniting the pioneering spirit that lies within us all.",

Paying salaries sends the wrong message about what college is for.\nCompensating college athletes also creates a slippery slope and raises many tricky questions. Which athletes and sports get paid?

With smart policy and investment in infrastructure, universal internet access can be achieved to empower all people regardless of economic status. The digital divide demands that we take action to ensure no person is denied the ability to access this fundamentally important tool of the 21st century.",
