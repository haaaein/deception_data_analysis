Anonymity on social media has often been exploited by individuals and groups to spread misinformation, engage in cyberbullying, and even participate in criminal activities. By implementing a system of user identity verification, we can address these pressing concerns and create a safer, more accountable online environment.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of verifying user identities on social media is the ability to hold individuals accountable for their actions.

When individuals are unable to hide behind the veil of anonymity, they are less likely to engage in such abusive behaviors, as they can be more easily identified and held responsible.

        "claim": "Drug importation jeopardizes safety controls and the domestic pharma industry.",
        "argument": "Drug importation may seem like an easy way to lower drug prices, but it comes with serious risks that jeopardize the safety of American patients and the vitality of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. According to former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, \"drugs coming through unregulated channels pose risks\" as there are no assurances of proper manufacturing, storage, or handling. A 2017 report by the WHO estimated that 1 in 10 drugs in developing countries are substandard or falsified, some containing hazardous contaminants.\n\nImporting drugs also undermines crucial safety protocols and track-and-trace systems that the FDA has implemented to protect our drug supply. Dr. Marv Shepherd, a pharmacy security expert at the University of Texas, warns that \"parallel trade makes it easy for counterfeiters to introduce bogus drugs\" that pharmacists can't easily identify. Even drugs from \"safe\" countries like Canada are often manufactured elsewhere with little oversight.\n\nIf importation expands, it could devastate the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, which employs over 800,000 Americans and invests $100+ billion annually in R&D to develop life-saving treatments. Experts predict importation would lead to significant American job losses. As imported cut-rate drugs flood the market, U.S. drug companies would be forced to slash investment in research for new cures. As a result, medical innovation would slow to a trickle, depriving millions of promising new therapies.\n\nFor the safety of patients and the future of American pharmaceutical innovation, the risks of drug importation are too high. We must find other solutions to rising drug costs that don't jeopardize secure medicine supplies and crucial drug development.",
