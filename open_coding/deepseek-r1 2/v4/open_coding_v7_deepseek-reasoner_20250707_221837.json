        "argument": "Social media has brought many benefits to society through greater connection and sharing of ideas. However, anonymity on these platforms has also enabled harmful behavior like bullying, harassment, and the spread of misinformation to run rampant without accountability. Requiring social media users to verify their real identities would curb these abuses and make online spaces healthier.\nResearch shows that when people use their real names, they are far less likely to say things they would not say in person. Verified identities incentivize better behavior by removing the shield of anonymity. This could help reduce toxic interactions by over 25% according to a study at Harvard. It would also make spreading demonstrably false information far more difficult, curbing the influence of bots and trolls seeking only to divide society.\nWhile some value anonymity, it comes at too great a cost to civil discourse online. With identity verification, social media companies could better address harmful behavior through a system of progressive consequences for bad actors. This would make their platforms safer and improve the experience for law-abiding users seeking real discussion. Overall, verified identities appear to be the optimal way to balance open sharing with accountability in social spaces.",
