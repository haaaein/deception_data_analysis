By failing to properly moderate content, social media companies are complicit in these harms.\n\nCritics argue that social media companies are simply platforms, and should not be liable for user-generated content. However, these companies curate content and use algorithms to actively promote and spread content - they are not neutral. They profit greatly from keeping users engaged, even with inappropriate content. It is unjust for companies to benefit financially from content that hurts society.  \n\nSocial media has enormous power and influence, and with that comes responsibility. Regulations are needed to force companies into taking content moderation seriously and being proactive about removing harmful posts. Fines for violations and legal liability would incentivize companies to make ethical content moderation a priority. Overall, social media platforms must be held accountable for harmful content on their platforms in order to curb damaging real-world effects and build a healthy online community.",

A comprehensive study by the Drone Safety Institute found only 142 reported incidents involving drones over the past 3 years, with nearly all causing no injuries. Imposing registration and testing requirements on such a popular activity in response to a negligible safety risk is a prime example of excessive government overreach. \nRegistration and testing also fail to address the chief concern with drones - their potential for misuse by those with criminal intent. Unfortunately, any regulations placed on lawful recreational users will do nothing to deter unlawful actors. Criminals will continue to operate drones illegally regardless of any policies put in place. Additional bureaucracy will only serve to discourage recreational drone use by creating hassles and fees for hobbyists who just want to enjoy this activity responsibly.  \nIn conclusion, mandatory registration and testing of recreational drones should be rejected. Doing so violates the freedom of many responsible drone operators for little gain, while failing to address the actual risks posed by drones in the wrong hands. Regulations should be narrowly tailored to unlawful misuse of drones, not imposed wholesale on those operating them safely and legally.

With continued technological progress, many analysts believe EVs will reach price parity with gas cars within the next decade.  \nPutting the phase-out in motion will also drive further innovation. It sends a clear market signal that boosts investment and job creation in the high-growth EV industry. Overall it will improve air quality and public health while reducing our dependence on imported oil. Most importantly, it helps ensure our children and grandchildren inherit a livable planet. A ban with a reasonable transition period is a small sacrifice for the sake of future generations. Our climate cannot afford further delay or half-measures. The time to act is now, before it's too late.",

This lack of transparency means ordinary citizens cannot make fully informed choices or hold big businesses accountable. \n\nAccording to a recent study published in Nature, just 100 companies are responsible for over 70% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. While corporate lobbying groups claim mandatory disclosure rules would be too burdensome, the same study found data collection would take minimal effort since most large multinationals already track their carbon footprints internally. If corporations have nothing to hide, they should welcome disclosure as an opportunity to highlight any sustainability initiatives. \n\nMandatory disclosure is also in corporations' long term self-interest. Younger generations increasingly prioritize environmental responsibilities when making purchases. As climate change devastation worsens, public pressure for green corporate accountability will only increase. Proactively disclosing climate impacts today builds goodwill that pays long term dividends in consumer preference and government relations. Countries like the UK already require corporate climate reporting with no undue compliance costs. It's time for the U.S. to follow suit to protect communities and accelerate private sector solutions to climate change.",

According to a study by the  Justice Policy Center, police agencies that have adopted body cameras experienced up to 60% fewer use of force incidents and over 90% fewer complaints against officers. With irrefutable video evidence, both police and the public they serve can feel confident in fair and just policing.\n\nDespite some concerns over cost and privacy, the benefits of body cameras far outweigh these potential downsides. An initial investment in body cameras will pay off through huge savings in legal fees and payouts within just a few years. Encrypted storage and strict privacy laws can address privacy concerns while still allowing camera footage to be accessed when necessary for accountability and evidence.   \n\nEveryone, including police officers themselves, will feel safer knowing their interactions are being recorded. Victims of police brutality will have proof to substantiate claims that have long been dismissed. Good police officers will have evidence to exonerate them from false accusations. If we truly want to foster trust between communities and the police who serve them, mandatory body cameras are a common sense solution that should be implemented nationwide without further delay.",

Fewer students would have the chance to compete and fewer would have their education funded. \n\nLet's continue supporting student-athletes through scholarships and stipends instead of risking the integrity of collegiate sports. Preserving amateurism ensures the focus stays on education first while still allowing talented athletes to develop their skills.

By removing the human driver from the equation, we can eliminate the poor decision making and reckless behavior that puts so many lives at risk. \nSelf-driving cars are also more adept at navigating traffic and avoiding collisions thanks to their advanced sensors and onboard computers. These systems can detect potential hazards far quicker than any human, apply brakes up to three times as fast, and make smarter decisions to avoid accidents altogether. Major tech companies report that their latest autonomous vehicles drive safer than humans and experts estimate that adopting self-driving cars could reduce traffic fatalities by up to 90% per year.\nWhile self-driving cars may seem like science fiction, the technology is real and ready for widespread use. Several states have already passed laws allowing for autonomous vehicle testing and broader implementation. Self-driving cars have the potential to drastically improve safety and save thousands of lives each year. It is time we embrace this lifesaving technology and begin transitioning to a future of autonomous vehicles. The sooner we make the switch, the sooner we can achieve vision zero and end the tragic loss of life from human-caused car crashes.",

        "argument": "For too long, our public education system has been stagnating due to its one-size-fits-all approach that fails to serve the diverse needs of students. However, charter schools provide an innovative solution that is expanding educational opportunities and driving real change. Studies have shown that charter schools are closing achievement gaps, with students from disadvantaged backgrounds demonstrating especially strong results (Center for Research on Education Outcomes, 2020). By freeing educators from bureaucratic restrictions, charter schools can tailor curriculums and teach methods that engage students in new and inspiring ways. They also empower parents to choose learning environments that best suit their children. \n\nWith increased public school funding yet stagnant test scores, it's clear that major reforms are needed. Charter schools provide healthy competition that motivates all schools to improve. In cities with more charter school options, public school students are benefiting from renewed focus on quality (National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, 2018). Charter schools now educate over 3 million students across dozens of states. As this movement grows, so too do the benefits of increased specialization, customized education, and innovation. Those still skeptical should take heart - charter schools must still meet academic standards, and failing schools can be closed. Overall, evidence shows that charter schools are raising the bar for achievement across the board. Our children deserve access to every educational opportunity, and charter schools deliver on that promise.",

Public schools have had to cut back on services like art, music, advanced classes, and support for students with special needs due to budget shortfalls exacerbated by the growth of charter schools. With less money for basic operating costs, the quality of education in public schools suffers, especially in low-income neighborhoods. We cannot have a two-tiered system that leaves the most vulnerable students behind. If we truly value equal opportunity for all children, regardless of background, we must fully and equitably fund traditional public schools instead of diverting scarce education dollars to privately-managed charters. Our public school system teaches the vast majority of students and it deserves the resources needed to provide every child with a high-quality education.",
