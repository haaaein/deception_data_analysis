According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, 92% of the public supports officers using body cameras. Requiring cameras nationwide would assure the people that law enforcement takes transparency and oversight seriously across all jurisdictions. While there are costs to implement a body camera program, those are outweighed by strengthening public confidence in the fairness and professionalism of our police. With cameras standard issue, both officers and civilians will feel safer knowing their interactions are documented objectively.

Many pilots groups already provide free online training and tips for safe operation without government mandates.\nUltimately, recreational drone flying should remain an accessible hobby that inspires future innovators.

Paying them large salaries on top of this educational subsidy seems unnecessary and excessive.\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, the average cost of college tuition and fees is over $23,000 per year for public schools and $50,000 per year for private schools.

This education is far more valuable in the long run than any short-term salary. \n\nIn addition, paying student athletes salaries could negatively impact the spirit of amateur competition in college athletics. Part of what makes college sports so compelling is that the athletes are students first, competing out of a love for the game and their school.

First, student athletes are already receiving an incredibly valuable education free of cost, an opportunity worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Paying them large salaries on top of this educational subsidy seems unnecessary and excessive.\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, the average cost of college tuition and fees is over $23,000 per year for public schools and $50,000 per year for private schools. At top Division I schools, the tuition value of a four-year athletic scholarship can be $200,000 or more.

Holding tech companies responsible for billions of daily user posts and comments is unrealistic and sets a dangerous precedent. \n\nAccording to a recent study, over 4.5 billion pieces of content are shared on social media every day. It is simply not feasible for platforms to monitor and moderate all of that content in real time. Despite investing heavily in content moderation, harmful posts will inevitably slip through the cracks. We cannot reasonably expect tech companies to achieve a 100% success rate at scale.\n\nIf we establish that platforms are liable for user-generated content, it will discourage innovation and limit free expression. Companies will adopt overzealous content moderation policies out of fear of legal punishment, removing harmless posts and stifling open debate. They may avoid launching new features over liability concerns. Individual users may censor themselves rather than risk a platform's wrath. \n\nFinally, ultimately individuals are responsible for their own speech. If a user posts hateful, unethical or illegal content, they should face consequences - not the platform they used. Platforms provide tools for communication and connection; they do not dictate how individuals choose to use those tools. Holding platforms liable for user actions both misplaces responsibility and excuses the real perpetrators of harmful speech.\n\nIn summary, imposing liability on social media companies for user-generated content is impractical, threatens open expression and innovation, and excuses individuals from responsibility for their own harmful speech.

They can also be easily confused by unexpected obstacles like construction zones, emergency vehicles, or complicated intersections.   Researchers at Stanford found that self-driving cars took up to 10 times longer than human drivers to navigate complicated intersections, putting other drivers and pedestrians in danger.\nWhile proponents argue self-driving cars will ultimately reduce accidents, prematurely putting self-driving cars on the roads could lead to a sharp increase in crashes that lead to injury or death. Self-driving cars are simply not equipped to handle the full range of scenarios that human drivers face everyday on our nation's roads and highways. Until self-driving cars are much safer, smarter and more advanced, they should not fully replace human drivers.",

        "argument": "Prescription drug ads being shown on television is already banned in most countries for good reason. Allowing commercials for prescription drugs to air confuses and manipulates consumers, encourages overprescription of drugs, and negatively impacts public health. Researchers at major universities found addiction to prescription drugs has spiked in countries that allow direct-to-consumer prescription drug ads. \nAccording to Harvard Medical School, pharmaceutical companies spend over $5 billion annually on television ads to aggressively market expensive brand-name drugs, even when cheaper generic alternatives are available.

When people see an ad about a condition they suffer from, it prompts them to do their own research and discuss potential treatment options with their physician. This exchange allows doctors to properly assess each patient's symptoms and medical history to determine the best course of action. Banning these ads would deny patients access to knowledge about conditions and latest treatment innovations. It also gives pharmaceutical companies economic incentive to invest in developing new drugs that could alleviate pain and suffering. A comprehensive review by the Food and Drug Administration found that risks of overprescription are relatively low because physicians still make independent judgments based on individual patient needs. If any issues do arise, less restrictive measures than an outright ban, like improved disclaimers, could help address them. Overall, the benefits of informed patients and progress against illness outweigh the limited risks, so prescription drug commercials should be permitted on television.",

        "argument": "Employee tracking takes privacy infringements too far and requires reasonable limitations. While employers have legitimate interests in monitoring work activities, current tracking capabilities violate personal freedoms and established privacy expectations. Through GPS, keylogging, and other advanced technologies, employers can now monitor every website visited, message sent, video watched, and call made - even when employees are off the clock. This level of surveillance goes beyond what is necessary for productivity or security purposes.\nNew research from the Electronic Privacy Information Center indicates that unfettered employee tracking can negatively impact mental health, reduce creativity and innovation, and discourage open communication. It fosters distrust in the workplace that harms overall company culture. Reasonable privacy is a basic right that should extend to professional contexts as well. Other developed nations like Canada, Germany and the UK have implemented sensible restrictions on employee tracking to balance these rights. \nWe should follow suit and establish guidelines for when, how and to what extent employers can track employees. Certain personal communications and after-hours activities clearly have no bearing on job duties. With minor adjustments, employers can still effectively oversee work tasks while respecting individual privacy as technology increasingly blurs lines between professional and personal lives. Reasonable restrictions on employee tracking are a sensible step to uphold civil liberties in the digital age.",
