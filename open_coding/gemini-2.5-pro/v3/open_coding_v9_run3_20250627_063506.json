        "argument": "Allowing censorship of legal speech on social media platforms risks stifling important debates and limiting the sharing of new ideas. While some may argue that censorship is needed to curb misinformation or offensive speech, such policies are too often applied inconsistently or arbitrarily. Who gets to determine what constitutes misinformation or what speech should be banned? Unduly expansive censorship sets a troubling precedent that could enable the suppression of minority or dissenting viewpoints under the guise of keeping platforms \"safe and civil.\"\n\nInstead of censorship, exposed speech is often the best remedy. When controversial opinions are aired in the open, their flaws and inaccuracies tend to be exposed through open debate and counter-speech. As a study published in the Harvard Law Review found, censorship often backfires by giving banned ideas an aura of taboo appeal. It is better to counter bad or false ideas with good ones, through open and vigorous discussion. Preemptively censoring legal speech also denies users the agency to decide for themselves what they will view and believe. \n\nOverall, erring on the side of open discourse uphold democratic values best. In a diverse, pluralistic society like ours, no central authority is capable of or entitled to make perfect, value-neutral judgments about what constitutes acceptable speech for all. The ultimate test of truth and social progress is open confrontation in the marketplace of ideas, not preemptive censorship by platforms.
