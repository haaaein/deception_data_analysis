Cultured meats are produced through stem cell cultivation rather than slaughter, avoiding the immense suffering of farm animals and making meat production far more humane and environmentally sustainable. A recent Life Cycle Analysis from Johns Hopkins University found that cultured meat uses 78-96% less land and produces 82-87% fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional livestock. As climate change impacts worsen and populations grow, transitioning to cultured meats could help ensure global food security. \n\nFrom an economic perspective, the meteoric expansion of the cultured meat sector is projected to create over 150,000 high-wage American manufacturing jobs within the next decade according to the Good Food Institute. Already, global corporations like Tyson Foods and Cargill are investing heavily in this promising industry.

        "argument": "Internet access should not be considered a basic human right. According to recent estimates, nearly half the world's population still lacks internet access. Declaring internet access a basic human right implies that governments and society have an obligation to provide every citizen with connectivity and the means to go online whenever they choose. However, this is an unrealistic and unfeasible goal that most countries do not have the infrastructure or funds to achieve. \nMore importantly, internet access is not essential for human survival and well-being in the way that access to food, water, shelter, and healthcare are. While the internet has become an important part of how we communicate and access information, it is still possible to live a safe, productive, and fulfilling life without constant connectivity. Many leaders, scientists, and thinkers throughout history did not have access to the internet and were still able to greatly impact the world.\nSome proponents argue that internet access should be a right because it enables access to information and facilitates civic engagement. However, public libraries, community centers, and schools can provide access to information and resources for those without their own connectivity. Civic participation also does not require constant internet access and there are many ways to stay engaged in the community offline.  \nIn conclusion, while internet access has significant benefits, it should not be classified as a basic human right. Access is not necessary for human survival and well-being, and not feasible for most governments and societies to provide universally. Public resources can fill the gaps for those without connectivity, and civic participation can thrive offline. It is a privilege, not a right.",

        "argument": "Social media companies should require users to verify their identities in order to curb the spread of misinformation and harassment online. Requiring real names and basic identity verification would help hold users accountable for their words and actions, reducing toxic behavior.\nAccording to reputable studies, over 60% of adults have experienced harassment on social media. Much of this is enabled by anonymity - it is easy to spread lies and harass others when you can hide behind a fake username. Identity verification would discourage such behavior by attaching real consequences to online actions. \nRequiring real identities would also help curb the spread of \"fake news\" and conspiracy theories on social media. Research shows that anonymity emboldens people to share and believe false information. Trolling and propaganda thrive when identities are obscured. By verifying users, social media companies gain more data to better detect inauthentic accounts and manipulative behaviors.  \nWhile some argue that anonymity protects free speech or privacy, these concerns are overblown. Requiring real names does not prevent people from expressing opinions or sharing personal details - it simply attaches accountability to those actions. For most users, the benefits of reduced toxicity and misinformation would far outweigh any perceived loss of anonymity. Overall, identity verification is a reasonable policy that would create a healthier environment on social media.\n\nIn summary, mandatory identity verification on social media has significant benefits with minimal downsides. It would curb harassment, reduce fake news, and create more accountability - resulting in a more trustworthy and constructive experience for all users. Social media companies should make this responsible policy change to better serve their users and society.",

It would also make spreading demonstrably false information far more difficult, curbing the influence of bots and trolls seeking only to divide society.\nWhile some value anonymity, it comes at too great a cost to civil discourse online. With identity verification, social media companies could better address harmful behavior through a system of progressive consequences for bad actors. This would make their platforms safer and improve the experience for law-abiding users seeking real discussion. Overall, verified identities appear to be the optimal way to balance open sharing with accountability in social spaces.",

        "argument": "Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour would significantly improve living standards for millions of hardworking Americans struggling to get by, boost economic growth, and reduce income inequality -- all at virtually no cost to taxpayers or businesses. \n\nAccording to research from the Economic Policy Institute, raising the minimum wage to $15 would directly or indirectly lift the wages of 33 million low-wage workers, who would earn $62 billion more in increased wages. This extra money in workers' pockets would circulate through local economies and generate up to $25 billion in new GDP. Studies show minimum wage increases have little to no impact on employment levels or hours worked, as higher pay boosts worker productivity and morale while reducing employee turnover costs for businesses.  \n\nWhile critics argue that raising the minimum wage would burden small businesses, two-thirds of those affected by a $15 minimum wage work for large corporations with over 100 employees that can easily absorb wage increases. And even for small businesses, studies show that the benefits of higher consumer spending, reduced employee turnover, and higher productivity would offset most or all of the costs. \n\nRaising the minimum wage is a proven, effective policy to reduce inequality, reward hard work, and stimulate economic growth. It's time we establish a living wage and ensure that no American who works full time lives in poverty.

According to an MIT study, self-driving cars today only log an average of about 50 miles between \"disengagements\" where the human driver has to take over control.  At highway speeds, that means a human would have to intervene once every 30 minutes to avoid an accident.  \nSelf-driving cars also struggle in challenging driving conditions like heavy rain, snow, or at night—precisely the conditions where accidents are most likely  to occur according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. They can also be easily confused by unexpected obstacles like construction zones, emergency vehicles, or complicated intersections.   Researchers at Stanford found that self-driving cars took up to 10 times longer than human drivers to navigate complicated intersections, putting other drivers and pedestrians in danger.\nWhile proponents argue self-driving cars will ultimately reduce accidents, prematurely putting self-driving cars on the roads could lead to a sharp increase in crashes that lead to injury or death. Self-driving cars are simply not equipped to handle the full range of scenarios that human drivers face everyday on our nation's roads and highways. Until self-driving cars are much safer, smarter and more advanced, they should not fully replace human drivers.",

It also gives pharmaceutical companies economic incentive to invest in developing new drugs that could alleviate pain and suffering. A comprehensive review by the Food and Drug Administration found that risks of overprescription are relatively low because physicians still make independent judgments based on individual patient needs. If any issues do arise, less restrictive measures than an outright ban, like improved disclaimers, could help address them. Overall, the benefits of informed patients and progress against illness outweigh the limited risks, so prescription drug commercials should be permitted on television.",

While risks to colonists will inevitably be high as we explore the unknown, the potential rewards far outweigh these dangers. \n\nStudies by NASA and leading astrobiologists have estimated there is a 30% chance any first manned Mars mission could result in loss of life due to unforeseen circumstances. However, restrictive risk policies would make any Mars landing virtually impossible with our current technology. Pioneers who journey to settle the frontier have always faced mortality risks far above what is acceptable today. If we had placed limits on acceptable risk, we may have never reached many amazing accomplishments, such as landing on the Moon.  \n\nEstablishing a human settlement on Mars could unlock discoveries that boost science and technology in ways we can't imagine. It could also act as an \"off-world backup\" to preserve humanity in the event of a global catastrophe on Earth. The risks of inaction may in fact be greater than the risks of these initial missions. While protecting lives is paramount, some measure of risk is necessary for the advancement of the human species. Future generations will marvel at our courage in choosing to reach for the stars despite the dangers. Let our pioneering spirit soar unbound to new horizons.

Progressive policies like universal healthcare, paid family leave, affordable housing, and a higher minimum wage have been shown to significantly narrow gaps in life expectancy between income groups. These evidence-based approaches will benefit many more people and help build a more just, inclusive society for all.",
