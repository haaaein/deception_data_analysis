With great power comes great responsibility. As private companies, they have a moral duty to consider the impact their platforms have and to take reasonable steps to prevent demonstrable harm.\nResearch from Harvard, MIT, and the University of Oxford shows that unchecked toxic content on social media disproportionately impacts more vulnerable groups like minorities and fosters a hostile online climate that spills over into the real world. According to studies published in leading scientific journals, exposure to certain types of hateful, conspiratorial, or harmful speech on social platforms correlates with increased levels of anxiety, depression, and even violent radicalization in some cases.  \nWhile censorship should always be an approach of last resort, moderating the most blatant objectionable content is reasonable and necessary. By no means would it infringe on free expression, as credible outlets for legal speech will continue to exist elsewhere. The benefits of preventing real damage to people's mental health and societal cohesion, as shown in the research, far outweigh the costs of limited, sensible moderation of unprotected speech like direct threats or incitement of violence. As companies that billions choose to use each day, social platforms must consider their duty of care and role in responsibly stewarding public discourse. Limited, good-faith moderation of the most clearly harmful speech is a reasonable aspect of fulfilling that duty.",

Paying them large salaries on top of this educational subsidy seems unnecessary and excessive.\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, the average cost of college tuition and fees is over $23,000 per year for public schools and $50,000 per year for private schools.

To truly tackle this crisis, we must move away from gas-powered vehicles toward zero-emissions alternatives like electric cars. Banning new gas car sales after [2030] would accelerate this necessary transition, reducing emissions and saving lives.\nAccording to the WHO, 4.2 million premature deaths occur each year due to pollution from vehicles and other sources. As the number of gas-powered cars has risen, so too have rates of respiratory diseases and conditions like asthma. Transitioning to electric vehicles would cut emissions of toxic pollutants like nitrogen oxides by over 90% compared to gas-powered cars, resulting in immediate and substantial public health benefits.  \nClimate change also poses an urgent threat, and transportation accounts for nearly 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions according to the EPA. Replacing just half of the nation's gas-powered cars with EVs would reduce U.S. CO2 emissions by over 600 million metric tons per year, the equivalent of closing more than a dozen coal-fired power plants. By transitioning fully to EVs, the U.S. could achieve nearly half of the emissions cuts needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nWhile a ban on new gas car sales may seem drastic, it simply accelerates an inevitable and necessary transition that is already underway. Major automakers like GM and Volkswagen have announced plans to shift focus from gas to electric vehicles. As costs continue to fall, EVs are becoming more affordable and appealing to consumers.

        "argument": "Self-driving cars are the way of the future and should begin replacing human drivers as soon as possible. Recent advancements in autonomous vehicle technology have shown that self-driving cars can dramatically decrease the number of car accidents and make our roads safer. According to studies from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, over 90% of car crashes today are caused by human error. By removing the human driver from the equation, we can eliminate the poor decision making and reckless behavior that puts so many lives at risk. \nSelf-driving cars are also more adept at navigating traffic and avoiding collisions thanks to their advanced sensors and onboard computers. These systems can detect potential hazards far quicker than any human, apply brakes up to three times as fast, and make smarter decisions to avoid accidents altogether. Major tech companies report that their latest autonomous vehicles drive safer than humans and experts estimate that adopting self-driving cars could reduce traffic fatalities by up to 90% per year.\nWhile self-driving cars may seem like science fiction, the technology is real and ready for widespread use. Several states have already passed laws allowing for autonomous vehicle testing and broader implementation.

Kids today are also spending an incredible amount of time engaged with their phones and online - one study found that the average teen spends at least 7 hours per day looking at screens, with most of that time focused on entertainment and social media use.\nThis level of technology immersion at a young age can be highly detrimental to a child's mental and social health. Their brains are still developing, and spending prolonged periods engaged in social comparison and instant gratification-seeking behaviors fostered by platforms like Instagram or Snapchat can rewire neural pathways in harmful ways. Such frequent technology use also disrupts activities critical for development like physical exercise, social interaction, and sleep. \nTo protect our children during this crucial stage of growth, smartphones and social media should be banned for kids under 16. This policy would give them many more years to develop physically, emotionally, and socially without the influence of excessive technology and social media use. While some argue this is an extreme policy that infringes on personal freedoms, our children's wellbeing and healthy development should be the top priority. Smartphone and social media use can always be slowly and carefully integrated when they are older and better equipped to handle it. For now, an outright ban is the best approach.",

Allowing such modification crosses an ethical line and could have devastating, unintended consequences. While the desire to prevent diseases or enhance traits is understandable, tampering with the human germline is a scientific Pandora's box we are not prepared to open.\nResearch suggests that genetic changes made in embryos may not always express as intended and could cause unanticipated mutations with serious health effects later in life. Some modified genes may even be passed down through generations, permanently altering the human gene pool in ways we fail to foresee. This level of human experimentation should not be taken lightly. Sure, proponents argue a few tweaks here or there are safe, but where do we draw the line, and how do we know the full ramifications? It's a slippery slope toward a brave new dystopian world.\nFreedom of choice is also compromised once genetic engineering becomes a mainstream way to \"enhance\" unborn children.
