        "claim": "Social media should not be required to verify user identities",
        "argument": "Requiring social media companies to verify user identities would be a drastic invasion of privacy. Forcing people to provide personal information like government IDs or social security numbers just to engage in online conversation fundamentally undermines the principles of anonymity and open discourse that the internet was built upon. While verifying identities may help slow the spread of misinformation in some cases, it would come at too high a cost to civil liberties.\nRecent research from the Pew Institute for Internet and American Life found that nearly 40% of social media users report being concerned about privacy and anonymity online. Requiring identity verification would likely drive many people off these platforms entirely and diminish their ability to serve as forums for open exchange and the sharing of new ideas. Some marginalized groups in particular rely on anonymity to discuss sensitive issues and avoid potential censorship or retaliation.  \nInstead of an identity mandate, social media companies should focus on technological solutions that make false information less likely to spread virally without compromising users' privacy. Fact-checking organizations could also be given more resources to quickly debunk viral misinformation without people needing to forfeit their anonymity. Overall, protecting civil liberties should take priority over attempts to eliminate falsehoods, as some degree of erroneous information is an inevitable part of a truly free exchange of ideas.  \nIn conclusion, while misinformation is a problem online, requiring identity verification goes too far in undermining principles of privacy and open discourse that are important to protecting in the digital public square. Alternative approaches are available that can curb false viral content without such drastic measures against basic online civil liberties.",

        "argument": "College athletes should not receive salaries for their participation in athletics for several reasons. First, student athletes are already receiving an incredibly valuable education free of cost, an opportunity worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Paying them large salaries on top of this educational subsidy seems unnecessary and excessive.\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, the average cost of college tuition and fees is over $23,000 per year for public schools and $50,000 per year for private schools. At top Division I schools, the tuition value of a four-year athletic scholarship can be $200,000 or more. This education is far more valuable in the long run than any short-term salary. \n\nIn addition, paying student athletes salaries could negatively impact the spirit of amateur competition in college athletics. Part of what makes college sports so compelling is that the athletes are students first, competing out of a love for the game and their school. Paying them large salaries risks turning them into quasi-professional athletes, and could damage that spirit of amateurism.\n\nFinally, paying college athletes could exacerbate issues of inequality between large and small schools. While top colleges in major conferences like the SEC and Big 10 could likely afford to pay athletes, smaller schools would struggle to match those salaries. This could tilt the competitive balance even further in favor of the major powers, making it difficult for smaller schools to compete on and off the field.\n\nIn conclusion, while some argue college athletes deserve to be paid given the time they dedicate and the money they help generate, paying them large salaries on top of their educational benefits risks damaging the spirit of college athletics and creating further inequality.

With footage available from an officer's point of view, frivolous allegations of misconduct can be dismissed or proven quickly. \n\nAt the same time, body cameras hold officers accountable by deterring unjustified actions and catching misconduct that does occur on video. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, 92% of the public supports officers using body cameras. Requiring cameras nationwide would assure the people that law enforcement takes transparency and oversight seriously across all jurisdictions. While there are costs to implement a body camera program, those are outweighed by strengthening public confidence in the fairness and professionalism of our police. With cameras standard issue, both officers and civilians will feel safer knowing their interactions are documented objectively. The footage provides an impartial record that can protect officers doing their jobs properly and protect the rights of the public. For these reasons, all police departments should adopt universal policies for body-worn cameras.",

Any new life-extending technologies would likely be exorbitantly expensive, putting them out of reach for all but the richest. \n\nAccording to a study published in Science, it may take over $1 million worth of daily treatments to slow aging by just one year. Many could not afford even standard medical care, let alone such costly experimental treatments. Pursuing lifespan extension at this time would exacerbate economic disparities in health. \n\nRather than increasing longevity through expensive, disruptive medical interventions that deepen societal inequities, we should focus on improving overall population health through more equitable social and economic policies. Progressive policies like universal healthcare, paid family leave, affordable housing, and a higher minimum wage have been shown to significantly narrow gaps in life expectancy between income groups. These evidence-based approaches will benefit many more people and help build a more just, inclusive society for all.",

        "argument": "While anti-aging therapies that prolong life and treat age-related diseases would certainly be expensive, limiting access to them based on cost alone would be short-sighted and detrimental to humanity in the long run. \n\nFirst, the potential medical and economic benefits are too great not to pursue. According to researchers at Stanford University, therapies that extended the healthy human lifespan by just 5 years could prevent over $7 trillion in medical costs in the U.S. alone. As more people live longer, healthier lives, it would reduce strain on social security and healthcare systems over time. \n\nSecond, denying access to therapies purely due to expense would be unethical, discriminating against those unable to afford them. Everybody deserves the chance at a longer, higher-quality life. Providing limited public funding or subsidies could help make therapies available to more people, even if not fully covered. \n\nLastly, limiting development and access to anti-aging therapies now would severely hamper medical progress. According to experts at Johns Hopkins, therapies pushing back human aging are on the verge of clinical testing and could be available within a decade or two. But we risk losing decades of progress and the true benefits to humanity if development and research are cut short due to profit concerns alone. \n\nIn summary, while costs are a concern, the potential scientific, medical and economic upside of anti-aging therapies is too great not to pursue vigorously through public and private means. Denying access based on cost discrimination or profit concerns alone risks immense, long-term harm.

This trend seems certain to worsen without oversight.\nRegistration and testing provides an effective path toward shared responsibility between drone pilots and regulators. The test would simply ensure recreational pilots understand basic safety procedures like keeping drones within visual line of sight and below 400 feet. Registration allows authorities to work with operators to resolve incidents and educate pilots on new safety risks like temporary flight restrictions around wildfires or accidents. This balanced approach allows drone Pilots to continue safely enjoying this creative hobby while upholding everyone's right to security and privacy. When weighing convenience against public safety, responsible regulation is a reasonable compromise that most citizens support.",

While drones enable fun and exciting hobbies for many, their misuse poses serious safety and privacy risks that responsible regulation can help address.\nResearch shows that the number of recreational drones in use has increased by nearly 500% in just the past 3 years. At the same time, the rate of dangerous drone incidents like near collisions with manned aircraft or interference with emergency response operations has also climbed sharply. One aviation safety organization estimates that unregulated recreational drones now contribute to over 25% of all non-military aviation incidents annually. This trend seems certain to worsen without oversight.\nRegistration and testing provides an effective path toward shared responsibility between drone pilots and regulators. The test would simply ensure recreational pilots understand basic safety procedures like keeping drones within visual line of sight and below 400 feet. Registration allows authorities to work with operators to resolve incidents and educate pilots on new safety risks like temporary flight restrictions around wildfires or accidents. This balanced approach allows drone Pilots to continue safely enjoying this creative hobby while upholding everyone's right to security and privacy.

Small businesses employ over half of Americans and are struggling to stay afloat as it is with rising costs of supplies, healthcare, and other operation expenses.

If major corporations are mandated to pay higher wages, many will automate positions currently held by lower-skilled workers or move jobs overseas where labor is cheaper.

Furthermore, research from the University of Washington shows that higher minimum wages do little to actually help lift families out of poverty in the long-run.
