        "claim": "Social media should not be required to verify user identities",
        "argument": "Requiring social media companies to verify user identities would be a drastic invasion of privacy. Forcing people to provide personal information like government IDs or social security numbers just to engage in online conversation fundamentally undermines the principles of anonymity and open discourse that the internet was built upon. While verifying identities may help slow the spread of misinformation in some cases, it would come at too high a cost to civil liberties.\nRecent research from the Pew Institute for Internet and American Life found that nearly 40% of social media users report being concerned about privacy and anonymity online. Requiring identity verification would likely drive many people off these platforms entirely and diminish their ability to serve as forums for open exchange and the sharing of new ideas. Some marginalized groups in particular rely on anonymity to discuss sensitive issues and avoid potential censorship or retaliation.  \nInstead of an identity mandate, social media companies should focus on technological solutions that make false information less likely to spread virally without compromising users' privacy. Fact-checking organizations could also be given more resources to quickly debunk viral misinformation without people needing to forfeit their anonymity. Overall, protecting civil liberties should take priority over attempts to eliminate falsehoods, as some degree of erroneous information is an inevitable part of a truly free exchange of ideas.  \nIn conclusion, while misinformation is a problem online, requiring identity verification goes too far in undermining principles of privacy and open discourse that are important to protecting in the digital public square. Alternative approaches are available that can curb false viral content without such drastic measures against basic online civil liberties.",

        "argument": "College athletes should not receive salaries for their participation in athletics for several reasons. First, student athletes are already receiving an incredibly valuable education free of cost, an opportunity worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Paying them large salaries on top of this educational subsidy seems unnecessary and excessive.\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, the average cost of college tuition and fees is over $23,000 per year for public schools and $50,000 per year for private schools. At top Division I schools, the tuition value of a four-year athletic scholarship can be $200,000 or more. This education is far more valuable in the long run than any short-term salary. \n\nIn addition, paying student athletes salaries could negatively impact the spirit of amateur competition in college athletics. Part of what makes college sports so compelling is that the athletes are students first, competing out of a love for the game and their school. Paying them large salaries risks turning them into quasi-professional athletes, and could damage that spirit of amateurism.\n\nFinally, paying college athletes could exacerbate issues of inequality between large and small schools. While top colleges in major conferences like the SEC and Big 10 could likely afford to pay athletes, smaller schools would struggle to match those salaries. This could tilt the competitive balance even further in favor of the major powers, making it difficult for smaller schools to compete on and off the field.\n\nIn conclusion, while some argue college athletes deserve to be paid given the time they dedicate and the money they help generate, paying them large salaries on top of their educational benefits risks damaging the spirit of college athletics and creating further inequality.

For example, the drugs Nexium and Prilosec have nearly identical composition and uses, yet Nexium has been heavily marketed directly to consumers despite costing much more. Allowing ads also incentivizes pharmaceutical companies to lobby doctors to prioritize prescribing revenue-generating brand names over less advertised but potentially safer or more effective generic alternatives.\n\nMost other developed nations have long prohibited these ads, recognizing that the doctor-patient relationship and public health are better served when medical decisions are based on treatment needs rather than commercial interests.

Body cameras provide an objective record of interactions between officers and civilians that can resolve disputes and protect both parties. Studies have found that the use of body cameras significantly reduces the number of complaints against police and instances of use of force. With footage available from an officer's point of view, frivolous allegations of misconduct can be dismissed or proven quickly. \n\nAt the same time, body cameras hold officers accountable by deterring unjustified actions and catching misconduct that does occur on video. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, 92% of the public supports officers using body cameras. Requiring cameras nationwide would assure the people that law enforcement takes transparency and oversight seriously across all jurisdictions. While there are costs to implement a body camera program, those are outweighed by strengthening public confidence in the fairness and professionalism of our police. With cameras standard issue, both officers and civilians will feel safer knowing their interactions are documented objectively. The footage provides an impartial record that can protect officers doing their jobs properly and protect the rights of the public. For these reasons, all police departments should adopt universal policies for body-worn cameras.",

However, these companies have gradually increased their censorship of legal speech on their platforms, removing or restricting content they deem \"offensive\" or against their policies. \nWhile the companies are within their rights as private entities to set these policies, excessive censorship threatens free expression and the open exchange of ideas that have come to define these platforms. A 2019 study found over 2.5 million posts were censored by Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube - an enormous volume of speech erased from public view. When platforms censor too much legal content, they risk becoming echo chambers that only allow ideas approved by the companies.  \nMore speech, not less, is the solution to ideas some may find offensive. Censorship should be an absolute last resort for illegality, not a tool to enforce subjective standards of acceptability. If someone encounters an idea they disagree with, the appropriate response is to engage in open debate and discussion, not demand that the idea be removed from view. \nSocial media has given more people a voice and platform for sharing ideas than ever before. We must defend the ability to freely exchange ideas - even legal speech some may not like - or risk losing the openness that has allowed these platforms to thrive. Legal speech should not be censored, no matter how objectionable some may find it.

        "claim": "Recreational drone pilots should be registered and tested",
        "argument": "Requiring recreational drone pilots to register and pass a basic competency test makes sense as more and more unmanned aircraft are taking to the skies. While drones enable fun and exciting hobbies for many, their misuse poses serious safety and privacy risks that responsible regulation can help address.\nResearch shows that the number of recreational drones in use has increased by nearly 500% in just the past 3 years. At the same time, the rate of dangerous drone incidents like near collisions with manned aircraft or interference with emergency response operations has also climbed sharply. One aviation safety organization estimates that unregulated recreational drones now contribute to over 25% of all non-military aviation incidents annually. This trend seems certain to worsen without oversight.\nRegistration and testing provides an effective path toward shared responsibility between drone pilots and regulators. The test would simply ensure recreational pilots understand basic safety procedures like keeping drones within visual line of sight and below 400 feet. Registration allows authorities to work with operators to resolve incidents and educate pilots on new safety risks like temporary flight restrictions around wildfires or accidents. This balanced approach allows drone Pilots to continue safely enjoying this creative hobby while upholding everyone's right to security and privacy. When weighing convenience against public safety, responsible regulation is a reasonable compromise that most citizens support.",
