Advancing age takes a massive physical and mental toll, causing deterioration that often leads to chronic illness, loss of independence, and decreased quality of life. By developing and providing anti-aging therapies, we can combat age-related decline and help older individuals maintain health, mobility, cognition, and autonomy. \n\nWhile anti-aging treatments may initially be expensive, the long-term benefits to both individuals and society make them worth the investment. Studies show that delaying age-related diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes by even a few years could save hundreds of billions in annual healthcare costs. For individuals, staying healthy in old age means avoiding expensive long-term care and maximizing time spent enjoying life. Many people fear aging not due to death itself but due to the prospect of physical and mental decay. Anti-aging therapies offer hope for aging on our own terms.\n\nSome argue that anti-aging therapies are unnecessary or \"cheating nature.\" However, for most of human history average lifespans were under 30 years - there is nothing natural about living into our 70s, 80s and beyond. Aging is a medical condition like any other, and just as we have developed treatments for diseases, we should develop treatments to slow, prevent or reverse aging. Doing so will benefit both current generations and future ones by reducing healthcare costs and allowing people to be productive for more years.

Paying them large salaries on top of this educational subsidy seems unnecessary and excessive.\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, the average cost of college tuition and fees is over $23,000 per year for public schools and $50,000 per year for private schools. At top Division I schools, the tuition value of a four-year athletic scholarship can be $200,000 or more. This education is far more valuable in the long run than any short-term salary. \n\nIn addition, paying student athletes salaries could negatively impact the spirit of amateur competition in college athletics. Part of what makes college sports so compelling is that the athletes are students first, competing out of a love for the game and their school. Paying them large salaries risks turning them into quasi-professional athletes, and could damage that spirit of amateurism.\n\nFinally, paying college athletes could exacerbate issues of inequality between large and small schools. While top colleges in major conferences like the SEC and Big 10 could likely afford to pay athletes, smaller schools would struggle to match those salaries. This could tilt the competitive balance even further in favor of the major powers, making it difficult for smaller schools to compete on and off the field.\n\nIn conclusion, while some argue college athletes deserve to be paid given the time they dedicate and the money they help generate, paying them large salaries on top of their educational benefits risks damaging the spirit of college athletics and creating further inequality.

        "argument": "While concerns over climate change and pollution are understandable, banning gas car sales too soon would be unrealistic and cause undue hardship. Transitioning an entire transportation infrastructure away from gas vehicles overnight is simply not feasible given current technology and consumer behavior. \n\nMillions of Americans rely on gas cars as their primary mode of transportation. For many lower-income families living in more remote areas without robust public transit options, an electric vehicle is still not a realistic or affordable replacement. According to a recent survey by the Independent Research Group, over 60% of Americans say they would struggle to afford a suitable electric vehicle to replace their current gas car within the next 5 years.  \n\nLet's also consider how dependent industries like construction, shipping/logistics, and agriculture still are on gas vehicles for their daily operations. Moving their entire fleets to EVs nationwide in just a few years would be an enormous financial burden that could cripple many small businesses and disrupt vital supply chains. \n\nInstead of premature bans, governments should pursue more pragmatic policies that incentivize the sustainable transition. Rising fuel efficiency standards, tax credits for electric vehicles, and increased investment in public charging infrastructure can all help accelerate consumer adoption of EVs over the next decade as technology continues advancing, without risking serious economic damage or leaving behind lower-income drivers.

        "argument": "Social media platforms should not be held liable for harmful content posted by individual users. Holding tech companies responsible for billions of daily user posts and comments is unrealistic and sets a dangerous precedent. \n\nAccording to a recent study, over 4.5 billion pieces of content are shared on social media every day. It is simply not feasible for platforms to monitor and moderate all of that content in real time. Despite investing heavily in content moderation, harmful posts will inevitably slip through the cracks. We cannot reasonably expect tech companies to achieve a 100% success rate at scale.\n\nIf we establish that platforms are liable for user-generated content, it will discourage innovation and limit free expression. Companies will adopt overzealous content moderation policies out of fear of legal punishment, removing harmless posts and stifling open debate. They may avoid launching new features over liability concerns. Individual users may censor themselves rather than risk a platform's wrath. \n\nFinally, ultimately individuals are responsible for their own speech. If a user posts hateful, unethical or illegal content, they should face consequences - not the platform they used. Platforms provide tools for communication and connection; they do not dictate how individuals choose to use those tools. Holding platforms liable for user actions both misplaces responsibility and excuses the real perpetrators of harmful speech.\n\nIn summary, imposing liability on social media companies for user-generated content is impractical, threatens open expression and innovation, and excuses individuals from responsibility for their own harmful speech. Social media platforms should not face legal punishment for content posted by users. The solution lies in individuals using platforms responsibly, not in stifling tech companies' abilities to operate and connect people around the world.",

        "argument": "Charter schools are one of the brightest hopes we have for revitalizing our education system. By embracing more school choice and fostering educational innovation, charter schools provide crucial opportunities for today's youth that the traditional public school model struggles to match.\nAccording to recent studies, students at charter schools show substantially higher gains in both reading and math. A 5-year Stanford study found that charter school students gained the equivalent of 72 additional days of reading and 101 days of math per year, compared to their public school peers. With results like these, how can we deny families the right to choose charter schools?  \nBeyond improving outcomes, charter schools drive much-needed innovation that traditional schools have failed to achieve. Unencumbered by bureaucracy and red tape, charter schools have the freedom to experiment with longer school days, project-based learning, and new technologies. The most successful models can then be replicated across schools and districts.

        "argument": "Requiring recreational drone pilots to register their drones and undergo testing is an unnecessary bureaucratic burden that will stifle the growth of this exciting new hobby for many. While safety is important, the statistics simply do not support onerous new restrictions at this time.\nAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration's own data, there have been fewer than 50 reported incidents of recreational drones coming into contact with manned aircraft or crashing on airport property since 2009. Meanwhile, over 1 million recreational drones have been sold in just the last year alone. That equates to an incident rate of around .005%. This is quite low when compared to traditional aviation activities.\nRather than punishing the vast majority of responsible drone pilots with new regulations, the FAA would be better served focusing enforcement efforts on the small number of bad actors flying irresponsibly. Restrictions should be a last resort. A better approach is to promote safer flying practices through education. Many pilots groups already provide free online training and tips for safe operation without government mandates.\nUltimately, recreational drone flying should remain an accessible hobby that inspires future innovators. Excessive registration and testing threatens to curb the creative spirit at the heart of this exciting new industry before it has really taken off. Safety is best achieved through cooperation, not regulation. Our leaders in Washington should reject new restrictions that offer more bureaucracy than benefit.",

With increased productivity comes increased profits and business growth, benefitting both the company and the overall economy. \n\nSecond, monitoring employees deters undesirable workplace behavior and protects companies from legal liability. When employees know their actions are being tracked, they are far less likely to engage in harassment, theft, violence, or other harmful acts. They also have an incentive to follow all company policies and procedures to avoid punishment or termination. This helps create a safe, ethical work environment and limits the company's exposure to expensive lawsuits.  \n\nFinally, employee tracking does not violate reasonable expectations of privacy in the workplace. Most companies own the technology and equipment that employees use, and employees consent to some level of oversight when they accept a job. While monitoring should be limited to work hours and work-related activities, employers are within their rights to utilize tracking mechanisms on company time and property.

And when we consider that we require testing and licenses for operating vehicles, firearms, and even ham radios due to public safety risks, ensuring drone pilots are properly trained seems more than reasonable.  \n\nIn conclusion, drone technology is taking off, and it's time for regulations to follow suit.
