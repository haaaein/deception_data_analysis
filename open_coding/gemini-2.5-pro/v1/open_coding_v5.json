By keeping the internet classified as a service rather than a right, societies can work to expand access in a responsible, sustainable way that balances the opportunities and risks involved. Efforts to close the digital divide should continue, but we must have realistic expectations about the role of internet access as a component of overall human wellbeing and flourishing.",

        "argument": "Geoengineering, the large-scale deliberate intervention in the Earth's climate system to mitigate the effects of climate change, poses grave risks that far outweigh any potential benefits. While the prospect of a technological fix to the climate crisis may seem tempting, the reality is that geoengineering is an untested and unpredictable solution with the potential for catastrophic consequences.\n\nFirstly, the long-term impacts of geoengineering interventions are simply unknown. Techniques like solar radiation management or carbon capture and storage may have unintended and irreversible effects on global weather patterns, ocean currents, and ecosystems. A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that even small-scale geoengineering experiments could trigger abrupt and severe changes in rainfall, potentially causing droughts, floods, and famines in vulnerable regions. The risks of large-scale deployment are even more dire, with the potential to disrupt food and water supplies for billions of people.\n\nSecondly, geoengineering poses serious geopolitical risks. The unilateral deployment of such technology by a single nation or group could have global consequences, potentially sparking international conflicts and tensions. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that geoengineering \"may be technically possible, [but] the impacts, costs and institutional challenges associated with it are not well understood.\" The risks of miscalculation, unilateral action, and lack of global coordination make geoengineering an inherently destabilizing proposition.\n\nGiven the high stakes and uncertain outcomes, the risks of geoengineering far outweigh any potential benefits. Rather than pursuing these untested and dangerous technological solutions, we should focus our efforts on proven, sustainable strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change, such as transitioning to renewable energy, reforestation, and changing agricultural practices.

Only 3% of reported drone incidents pose any real safety risk, according to a 2018 study by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, suggesting existing rules are a solution in search of a problem.  Moreover, the registration database is an invasion of privacy, as it could allow the government to track the location and activities of law-abiding citizens simply for flying a drone in their own backyard.\n\nOther developed countries like Japan, France and the UK allow recreational drone flights without registration for craft under a reasonable weight limit, often 250 grams. This pragmatic approach manages safety risks while enabling technological progress and respecting individual liberty. The U.S. drone industry is falling behind and losing an estimated $10 billion in economic value because of innovation-killing overregulation, according to the Consumer Technology Association.\n\nWe don't require licenses and testing for operating other products that could potentially cause harm, like cars, power tools, or baseball bats. The safe and responsible use of drones should be managed through education, not needless restrictions that smother an exciting emerging technology with vast positive potential. It's time for the FAA to adopt global best practices, scrap unnecessary rules, and allow recreational drone pilots to responsibly take to the skies unencumbered by burdensome government mandates.",

Over 4.6 billion people worldwide use social media, with the average person spending over 2 hours per day on these sites. Given their massive reach and impact, social media companies have a responsibility to keep their platforms safe and prevent the spread of harmful, dangerous, and illegal content.\n\nToo often, social networks hide behind claims of being \"neutral platforms\" and abdicate accountability for toxic content posted by users. But make no mistake, the algorithms and policies of these companies directly influence what content gets amplified and seen by millions. By allowing racism, misinformation, extremism, and explicit content to run rampant, social media platforms are complicit in real-world harms. Facebook has been used to livestream mass shootings and suicides. Twitter is a hotbed of targeted harassment. Instagram and TikTok are exposing kids and teens to predators and inappropriate material.\n\nIt's time to hold social media companies accountable, just like we do with other businesses. If a physical store allowed criminal activity to openly take place on their property, they would be liable. The same standard should apply to the virtual world. Platitudes are not enough - we need strict legal liability to force social networks to invest in better moderation, fact-checking, age restrictions, and removal of illegal content.

However, this approach is unrealistic and could have severe unintended consequences that hinder our progress towards a greener economy.\n\nFirst and foremost, the current infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities simply cannot support a complete and immediate transition to electric vehicles (EVs). A recent study by the Automotive Industry Association found that a premature ban on gas car sales would lead to a shortage of over 2 million vehicles per year, as EV production cannot yet meet the current demand. This supply shortage would drive up prices and limit access to affordable transportation options, disproportionately impacting lower-income communities.\n\nMoreover, the electric grid in many regions is not yet equipped to handle the increased electricity demand from widespread EV adoption. A survey by the Department of Energy revealed that over 60% of local utility companies are not confident in their ability to reliably provide the necessary power if gas car sales were banned today. Premature action could lead to frequent blackouts and power outages, hampering economic activity and disrupting people's daily lives.\n\nFinally, a hasty ban on gas car sales would jeopardize millions of jobs in the automotive and supporting industries.

The NCAA generated $1.1 billion in revenue in 2020 on the backs of college athletes, yet athletes see virtually none of that money. Top players contribute their skills, time, and hard work only to have billions of dollars flow around them. College football and basketball programs generate massive profits for universities, coaches, and the NCAA, and have turned into multi-billion dollar industries, yet players see none of it.\n\nPaying fair athlete salaries corrects this injustice. Star college athletes work full-time to train, practice, travel, and compete in their sport. They deserve fair pay for the value they create through their efforts. A reasonable salary of $50,000 per year for top players represents just a tiny fraction of the revenues they generate, while allowing them to earn a living.\n\nPaying athletes will also reduce scandals. Boosters and companies currently pay athletes illegally under the table, or funnel money to their families. Allowing upfront, transparent salaries decreases incentives for cheating. Critics argue salaries will disadvantage smaller programs, but innovative revenue sharing rules can promote parity. Compensating athletes is fair, reduces corruption, and maintains the integrity and spirit of college athletics. It's simply the right thing to do.",

This would enhance the integrity of college sports and ensure that academic institutions remain focused on their core educational mission.\n\nIn an era of skyrocketing costs and growing inequality, paying college athletes is a vital step toward fairness, transparency, and a more just system of higher education and athletic competition. The time has come to recognize the true value of these talented individuals and provide them with the compensation they rightfully deserve.",

        "argument": "Raising the minimum wage to $15 would hurt small businesses and lead to job losses. While the goal of helping low-income workers is admirable, this policy would have significant unintended consequences. \nMany small business owners operate on thin profit margins, especially in the food service and retail industries which employ a large number of minimum wage workers. Forcing these businesses to double their payroll expenses overnight would be financially devastating. A 2019 survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that over 75% of small business owners believe a $15 minimum wage would negatively impact their business.\nThis sudden financial burden would force small businesses to cut costs through reducing staff, cutting hours and benefits, and raising prices. The Congressional Budget Office projects that a $15 federal minimum wage could result in 1.3 million lost jobs over the next decade as businesses look to reduce labor costs. Workers who retain their jobs may end up with fewer hours or benefits.\nThe impact would fall disproportionately on small businesses that do not have the financial resources and flexibility that large corporations have. This could end up consolidating market share among dominant companies, thereby reducing competition. Just 27% of small businesses surveyed favored increasing the minimum wage to $15.\nWhile the aim to lift low-income workers out of poverty is a worthy one, a minimum wage hike to $15 would miss the mark and inadvertently harm the very people it intends to help by reducing job opportunities. More nuanced solutions that support small businesses, such as targeted tax credits, are called for.",

Anonymity on social media has often been exploited by individuals and groups to spread misinformation, engage in cyberbullying, and even participate in criminal activities. By implementing a system of user identity verification, we can address these pressing concerns and create a safer, more accountable online environment.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of verifying user identities on social media is the ability to hold individuals accountable for their actions. Currently, the ease with which anyone can create a fake or anonymous account allows for the rapid spread of false information, hate speech, and other harmful content without consequence. By requiring users to provide legitimate personal information, such as a government-issued ID or biometric data, social media platforms can effectively deter and track the source of such damaging content.\n\nMoreover, user identity verification can significantly reduce the prevalence of online harassment, bullying, and stalking. When individuals are unable to hide behind the veil of anonymity, they are less likely to engage in such abusive behaviors, as they can be more easily identified and held responsible.

This puts essential medications out of reach for millions of Americans, leading to poor health outcomes, increased hospitalizations, and even loss of life.\n\nBy allowing the safe importation of FDA-approved drugs from licensed pharmacies in other countries, we can immediately provide relief to patients struggling to afford their prescriptions. A study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that drug importation could save Americans up to $6.5 billion per year on their medication costs. This would be a game-changer for families living paycheck-to-paycheck and seniors on fixed incomes, who are often forced to ration or skip their medications due to unaffordable prices.\n\nConcerns over drug safety and quality can be effectively addressed through robust regulatory frameworks.

Recent data shows space tourism had a major accident rate of 1 in 4 flights in 2021 alone, compared to 1 in 4 million for commercial airlines. The consequences of space tourism accidents are also far more severe, with the 2021 Virgin Galactic crash tragically killing 2 crew members. Safety must be the top priority and universal guidelines for space tourism are still lacking.\n\nA collaborative report by top aerospace experts recommends a temporary moratorium on space tourism expansion until safety features like crew escape systems, launch vehicle redundancies, and pilot certification minimums are codified into official regulations. They estimate proper oversight would reduce space tourism's catastrophic failure rate to 1 in 40 flights. This seems a reasonable benchmark to ensure public safety while still allowing the industry to grow responsibly. \n\nIt's easy to get swept up in the excitement of the space tourism boom. But a measured, cautious approach is needed to avoid dangerous mishaps that could set the entire industry back years. With prudent safety limitations now, space tourism can thrive in the long-run. The wonder of space will still be waiting once we've developed systems to access it more reliably.",

Only 60% of the global population currently has internet access according to the UN, with rates much lower in developing countries. Declaring internet access a human right would place an enormous financial and logistical burden on governments to provide universal access that is simply not feasible in many parts of the world lacking basic infrastructure. The internet should be viewed as a valuable tool and service, but not an inalienable right.\nAdditionally, unfettered access to the internet comes with serious risks and downsides. Cyber crime, identity theft, disinformation, and online predators pose real dangers, especially to children and other vulnerable groups. Treating internet access as a human right could restrict the ability of families, communities, and nations to regulate the internet and protect citizens from these harms as they see fit.\nWhile the benefits of internet access are significant, they do not outweigh other more fundamental rights and needs that many across the globe still lack. By keeping the internet classified as a service rather than a right, societies can work to expand access in a responsible, sustainable way that balances the opportunities and risks involved.
