Advancing age takes a massive physical and mental toll, causing deterioration that often leads to chronic illness, loss of independence, and decreased quality of life. By developing and providing anti-aging therapies, we can combat age-related decline and help older individuals maintain health, mobility, cognition, and autonomy. \n\nWhile anti-aging treatments may initially be expensive, the long-term benefits to both individuals and society make them worth the investment. Studies show that delaying age-related diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes by even a few years could save hundreds of billions in annual healthcare costs. For individuals, staying healthy in old age means avoiding expensive long-term care and maximizing time spent enjoying life. Many people fear aging not due to death itself but due to the prospect of physical and mental decay. Anti-aging therapies offer hope for aging on our own terms.\n\nSome argue that anti-aging therapies are unnecessary or \"cheating nature.\" However, for most of human history average lifespans were under 30 years - there is nothing natural about living into our 70s, 80s and beyond. Aging is a medical condition like any other, and just as we have developed treatments for diseases, we should develop treatments to slow, prevent or reverse aging. Doing so will benefit both current generations and future ones by reducing healthcare costs and allowing people to be productive for more years.

Requiring real names and basic identity verification would help hold users accountable for their words and actions, reducing toxic behavior.\nAccording to reputable studies, over 60% of adults have experienced harassment on social media. Much of this is enabled by anonymity - it is easy to spread lies and harass others when you can hide behind a fake username. Identity verification would discourage such behavior by attaching real consequences to online actions. \nRequiring real identities would also help curb the spread of \"fake news\" and conspiracy theories on social media. Research shows that anonymity emboldens people to share and believe false information. Trolling and propaganda thrive when identities are obscured. By verifying users, social media companies gain more data to better detect inauthentic accounts and manipulative behaviors.  \nWhile some argue that anonymity protects free speech or privacy, these concerns are overblown.

        "argument": "According to government studies, nearly 25% of money allocated for public welfare programs like food stamps and Medicaid is lost annually to fraud and abuse. This amounts to billions of taxpayer dollars wasted when so many families depend on these benefits to survive. To remedy this egregious loss of money and ensure limited public funds are used as intended, welfare recipients should be carefully tracked to verify they actually qualify for and deserve the benefits they receive. \n\nBy tracking welfare recipients, the government can confirm they do not exceed income limits or fail to report relevant changes that would make them ineligible. For example, recent data shows over $1 billion in food stamp benefits were improperly paid to recipients with unreported income or assets that should have disqualified them. Regular check-ins and reviews of eligibility would reduce this waste and redirect funding to those truly in need. While privacy concerns have been raised, welfare programs by definition require recipients to share personal information to determine if they qualify. Tracking supports this existing process to make it more efficient and effective.\n\nWhen taxpayer money funds important social programs, accountability and transparency should be required. By implementing basic tracking procedures for welfare recipients, the government can cut down on fraud, reduce budget deficits, and reassure citizens their tax dollars are being spent responsibly. Welfare can and should be a temporary safety net for those facing hardship, not an open-ended entitlement prone to abuse. With smart reforms like tracking, it can fulfill its purpose of helping the most vulnerable during times of need.",

        "argument": "There is no doubt that mandatory body cameras for all police officers would bring increased transparency and accountability that is sorely needed. According to a study by the  Justice Policy Center, police agencies that have adopted body cameras experienced up to 60% fewer use of force incidents and over 90% fewer complaints against officers. With irrefutable video evidence, both police and the public they serve can feel confident in fair and just policing.\n\nDespite some concerns over cost and privacy, the benefits of body cameras far outweigh these potential downsides. An initial investment in body cameras will pay off through huge savings in legal fees and payouts within just a few years. Encrypted storage and strict privacy laws can address privacy concerns while still allowing camera footage to be accessed when necessary for accountability and evidence.   \n\nEveryone, including police officers themselves, will feel safer knowing their interactions are being recorded. Victims of police brutality will have proof to substantiate claims that have long been dismissed. Good police officers will have evidence to exonerate them from false accusations. If we truly want to foster trust between communities and the police who serve them, mandatory body cameras are a common sense solution that should be implemented nationwide without further delay.",

Thus, it is fair and reasonable for lenders to offer lower interest rates and down payments to those with higher scores. \n\nWhile some argue that credit scores disproportionately impact minority and low-income groups, credit scores themselves do not take demographic factors into account. They are based solely on one's paying bills on time, keeping low balances on credit cards, limiting hard inquiries into one's credit, and other proven indicators of financial responsibility. In fact, studies show the racial disparities often cited diminish greatly or disappear altogether when controlling for other socioeconomic factors.\n\nIn summary, credit scores and risk models offer a fair, objective, and statistically-proven method for insurers and lenders to determine premiums and lending terms.

It is better to counter bad or false ideas with good ones, through open and vigorous discussion. Preemptively censoring legal speech also denies users the agency to decide for themselves what they will view and believe. \n\nOverall, erring on the side of open discourse uphold democratic values best. In a diverse, pluralistic society like ours, no central authority is capable of or entitled to make perfect, value-neutral judgments about what constitutes acceptable speech for all. The ultimate test of truth and social progress is open confrontation in the marketplace of ideas, not preemptive censorship by platforms. For these reasons, social media platforms should refrain from censorship and allow legal speech, however offensive some may find it, to flow freely.",

Though proponents argue these products will be healthier, the long term consequences are simply uncertain. Until cultivation methods have withstood rigorous long-term review by experts, precaution is wisest. \n\nMoreover, a ban ensures the continued success of our domestic livestock industries. Farmers and ranchers are bedrocks of rural communities, with multi-generational legacies upholding our proud tradition of agrarian self-sufficiency. Artificially grown meats could seriously damage these livelihoods if adopted widely. With so many jobs at stake across Texas, Iowa and beyond, we must avoid risking rural economies when prudent alternatives exist. Consumers still wanting a real meat experience can choose products from America's trusted farmers instead. \n\nProtecting public health and preserving local industry are well within the purview of reasonable policy.

        "description": "Suggesting that because two events or phenomena are correlated, one must be the cause of the other, often to assign blame.",
        "example": "The argument states that social media use 'correlates with rising rates of anxiety, depression and loneliness' and then immediately concludes, 'By failing to properly moderate content, social media companies are complicit in these harms.' This makes a leap from a noted correlation to a direct causal claim of complicity."
