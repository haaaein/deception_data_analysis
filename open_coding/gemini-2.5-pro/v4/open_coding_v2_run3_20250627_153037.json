People without internet are shut out from all these crucial aspects of life.  A 2021 study by the UN found that 85% of the world's population now lives in an area with broadband internet access. However, there are still billions living without this access, disproportionately impacting marginalized communities. The internet has become so integral to modern life that a lack of access further drives inequality. Thus, we must start viewing internet in the same vein as other utilities like electricity and plumbing. Just as affordable access to water and power is considered a human right, internet access enables people to fully participate in society and exercise their basic rights as citizens. With smart policy and investment in infrastructure, universal internet access can be achieved to empower all people regardless of economic status.

Saddling American businesses with additional regulatory burdens risks hurting their ability to compete globally, potentially leading to lost profits, reduced hiring, and damage to the U.S. economy.\nThe SEC's own research shows that 90% of S&P 500 companies already voluntarily publish sustainability reports, demonstrating that heavy-handed government intervention is unnecessary. We should continue allowing market forces and consumer preferences to drive corporate climate transparency rather than imposing rigid one-size-fits-all mandates. As long as companies aren't lying or misleading the public, they should have flexibility in what environmental data they choose to track and report.",

In fact, economist Andrew Zimbalist estimates that less than 10% of Division I college sports programs turn a profit. Enforcing some arbitrary, unequal pay structure is a legal and ethical minefield.\nInstead of salaries, a better solution is to increase stipends and ensure scholarships fully cover the cost of attendance. This supports athletes' financial needs without turning amateur sports into pay-for-play. At the end of the day, college is meant to be an enriching educational experience, not a place to earn a paycheck for playing a game.",

With genetic engineering, we have the power to prevent the existence of these tragic conditions altogether, allowing more people to live full, healthy lives.\n\nBeyond the clear medical benefits, advances in genetic engineering also hold immense promise for enhancing positive human traits. By selectively editing genes associated with increased intelligence, physical prowess, longevity, and other desirable characteristics, we can create a healthier, more capable populace that is better equipped to tackle the global challenges of the future. This could lead to groundbreaking scientific discoveries, technological innovations, and solutions to humanity's most pressing problems.\n\nWhile there are understandable concerns about the ethics and safety of genetic engineering, rigorous testing and oversight can ensure that this technology is applied responsibly and equitably. With comprehensive regulations and the guidance of medical professionals and ethicists, we can harness the power of genetic engineering to improve the human condition without compromising our core values.\n\nIn the end, the potential to eliminate human suffering and enhance the human condition through genetic engineering is simply too great to ignore. By embracing this transformative technology, we can build a brighter, healthier, and more prosperous future for generations to come.",

Hudson Jr., argues, \"Anonymity is essential to the marketplace of ideas.\"\n\nAdditionally, the implementation of mandatory identity verification would pose significant technical and financial challenges for social media companies, potentially leading to increased costs that could be passed on to users or result in the exclusion of certain demographics from accessing these platforms altogether. According to a report by the Rand Corporation, the costs of implementing robust identity verification systems could be prohibitively high, especially for smaller social media platforms.\n\nIn conclusion, requiring social media platforms to verify user identities would undermine the fundamental principles of privacy, free speech, and accessibility that make these platforms so valuable to our society. Instead, we should focus on empowering users to make informed decisions about their own online engagement and protecting the rights and freedoms that are essential to a thriving digital landscape.",

This in turn will drive innovation and reward leaders. \n\nTransparency about climate impacts will allow the public to decide where to allocate their spending and investment dollars. Citizens want to know that businesses care about the planet they inhabit. John Smith, CEO of United Solar, says: “Consumers want to know a product’s carbon footprint just as much as its nutrition label.”  \n\nConsider the data from states with climate disclosure laws. An MIT study found that companies in those states reduced emissions an average of 8% more than in states without rules. Multiply such reductions economy-wide and society can meet its climate goals. \n\nMandated disclosure is popular. A Pew poll found 67% of Americans want the government to limit carbon emissions by business. They deserve to see who is leading and lagging in climate responsibility. Aren’t Americans free to spend how they wish? Let us empower them with data. This modest regulation will invigorate the economy, spur innovation, and allow citizens to choose wisely. We have every reason to back climate transparency and no good argument against it.",

        "argument": "Space tourism is an exciting prospect but one fraught with risks that necessitate strong safety regulations before it is broadly permitted. According to a 2022 study by the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, the current fatality rate for space travel is an alarming 3.2%, or about 1 in every 30 flights. Those are extremely dangerous odds compared to the airline industry, which has a fatality rate of just 0.07 per million flights.\n\nThe nascent space tourism industry is currently a risky Wild West with a patchwork of loose regulations and oversight. Unlicensed, undertested spacecraft are being allowed to carry paying customers despite limited safety features and emergency protocols. A 2021 report by the National Academy of Sciences called for the FAA to implement stronger licensing requirements, mandatory safety inspections, minimum training standards for pilots and crew, and clearer rules around passenger medical screening and informed consent.\n\nSome will argue these regulations will stifle innovation in this new industry, but the successful history of commercial aviation shows that strong safety rules actually enable industries to grow and thrive by giving the public confidence. Until space tourism can be made as safe and well-regulated as air travel, it should be tightly limited to essential missions and highly-trained professionals, not thrill-seeking tourists. If a string of high-profile accidents were to occur, it could ground the industry indefinitely. Rigorous safety regulations are needed now before tragedy strikes.",

With climate change advancing rapidly due in part to greenhouse gas emissions, we must act swiftly to curb our reliance on polluting fossil fuels. Gas-powered automobiles are a major contributor, accounting for nearly 20% of U.S. emissions. Phasing out gas car sales is an essential step towards meeting critical emissions reductions goals. \n\nElectric vehicles are now a viable alternative. Advances in EV battery range and charging infrastructure mean most drivers could switch without disruption. A recent study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that over 75% of U.S. drivers could charge an EV as their only car. Within a decade, it's projected that almost all could make the switch.\n\nFederal incentives like tax credits can ease the transition. We can look to Norway, where EV sales surpassed gas car sales after aggressive policy measures made EVs more affordable. With the right incentives, cost parity could be achieved in the U.S. auto market by 2025.\n\nPhasing out gas car sales also promises to spur American innovation and create jobs. With major automakers now on board, the EV transition will strengthen domestic manufacturing and position the U.S. as a leader in clean transportation. We can follow the lead of pioneering states like California that are phasing out gas cars. The time to act is now, before it's too late.

While the goal of helping low-income workers is admirable, this policy would have significant unintended consequences. \nMany small business owners operate on thin profit margins, especially in the food service and retail industries which employ a large number of minimum wage workers. Forcing these businesses to double their payroll expenses overnight would be financially devastating. A 2019 survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that over 75% of small business owners believe a $15 minimum wage would negatively impact their business.\nThis sudden financial burden would force small businesses to cut costs through reducing staff, cutting hours and benefits, and raising prices. The Congressional Budget Office projects that a $15 federal minimum wage could result in 1.3 million lost jobs over the next decade as businesses look to reduce labor costs. Workers who retain their jobs may end up with fewer hours or benefits.\nThe impact would fall disproportionately on small businesses that do not have the financial resources and flexibility that large corporations have. This could end up consolidating market share among dominant companies, thereby reducing competition. Just 27% of small businesses surveyed favored increasing the minimum wage to $15.\nWhile the aim to lift low-income workers out of poverty is a worthy one, a minimum wage hike to $15 would miss the mark and inadvertently harm the very people it intends to help by reducing job opportunities.

        "argument": "While the idea of compensating college athletes for their contributions to their universities may seem intuitively fair, the reality is that such a policy would be detrimental to the entire college sports ecosystem and the student-athletes themselves. Fundamentally, college sports are an integral part of the educational experience, not a professional enterprise, and paying athletes salaries would undermine this core purpose.\n\nFirst and foremost, providing salaries to college athletes would erode the amateur spirit that is central to the appeal and integrity of collegiate athletics. College sports are meant to be an extracurricular activity that complements the academic mission of these institutions, not a commercial venture. Transforming athletes into paid professionals would incentivize them to prioritize sports over their studies, defeating the very purpose of the student-athlete model.\n\nFurthermore, paying salaries would create an uneven playing field, favoring wealthier schools and programs that can afford to offer higher compensation. This would concentrate talent at a few elite institutions, reducing parity and competitiveness across the college sports landscape. It could also lead to recruiting wars and bidding wars for top prospects, distorting the college experience and potentially compromising academic standards.\n\nImportantly, the vast majority of college athletes do not go on to lucrative professional careers. Providing them with salaries could actually diminish their long-term earning potential by distracting them from their studies and reducing their chances of securing a valuable degree. By maintaining the current model, colleges can continue to offer athletes valuable scholarships, training, and other benefits that better serve their long-term interests.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of paying college athletes may seem appealing, the risks and unintended consequences of such a policy far outweigh any potential benefits. Preserving the amateur spirit and educational focus of college sports is essential for upholding the true purpose and value of these programs for student-athletes and universities alike.",
