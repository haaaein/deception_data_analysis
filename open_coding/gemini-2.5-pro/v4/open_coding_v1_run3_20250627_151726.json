This effectively excludes them from full participation in the economic, social, and political spheres.\n\nMoreover, the internet has become a critical platform for the free exchange of ideas and the exercise of fundamental rights like freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Restricting internet access is tantamount to restricting these core civil liberties. In the 21st century, internet access is as essential as access to clean water, adequate food, and basic shelter.\n\nProviding universal internet access is not only a moral imperative, but also a practical necessity for ensuring equal opportunities and upholding human rights in the digital age. Governments and policymakers must recognize internet access as a basic human right and take concrete steps to make it universally available and affordable. Doing so is essential for building a more just, equitable, and interconnected world.",

        "argument": "In the face of rising costs, increasing demands for accountability, and the need to maintain a dynamic, responsive, and innovative higher education system, the traditional system of tenure for university professors must be reformed or eliminated. While tenure was originally intended to protect academic freedom and promote rigorous research and scholarship, in practice it has become a barrier to progress and a hindrance to the evolution of our universities.\n\nFirstly, the current tenure system insulates professors from the need to continually prove their worth and relevance. Once granted tenure, many professors become complacent, content to coast on their past achievements rather than pushing the boundaries of their fields or adapting to changing student needs and market demands. This stifles innovation, limits the introduction of new ideas and teaching methods, and ultimately fails to serve the best interests of students, who are the lifeblood of our higher education system.\n\nFurthermore, the tenure process is often opaque and subject to bias, with personal connections and politics playing an outsized role in determining which professors receive this coveted status. This undermines meritocracy and denies opportunities to talented, energetic young scholars who could breathe new life into our universities. Reforming or eliminating tenure would inject much-needed dynamism and accountability into the system, ensuring that only the most productive and effective professors are retained and rewarded.\n\nFinally, the financial burden of tenured faculty salaries and benefits places a significant strain on university budgets, limiting the resources available for crucial investments in infrastructure, student support services, and other initiatives that enhance the overall quality of education. By reducing or eliminating tenure, universities would have greater flexibility to allocate their resources more strategically, better serving the needs of students and society as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, while the concept of tenure may have served a valuable purpose in the past, it is now a relic of a bygone era. By reforming or eliminating this outdated system, we can unlock the full potential of our universities, fostering a culture of innovation, accountability, and excellence that better prepares our students for the challenges of the 21st century.",

        "argument": "In the face of rising costs, increasing demands for accountability, and the need to maintain a dynamic, responsive, and innovative higher education system, the traditional system of tenure for university professors must be reformed or eliminated. While tenure was originally intended to protect academic freedom and promote rigorous research and scholarship, in practice it has become a barrier to progress and a hindrance to the evolution of our universities.\n\nFirstly, the current tenure system insulates professors from the need to continually prove their worth and relevance. Once granted tenure, many professors become complacent, content to coast on their past achievements rather than pushing the boundaries of their fields or adapting to changing student needs and market demands. This stifles innovation, limits the introduction of new ideas and teaching methods, and ultimately fails to serve the best interests of students, who are the lifeblood of our higher education system.\n\nFurthermore, the tenure process is often opaque and subject to bias, with personal connections and politics playing an outsized role in determining which professors receive this coveted status. This undermines meritocracy and denies opportunities to talented, energetic young scholars who could breathe new life into our universities. Reforming or eliminating tenure would inject much-needed dynamism and accountability into the system, ensuring that only the most productive and effective professors are retained and rewarded.\n\nFinally, the financial burden of tenured faculty salaries and benefits places a significant strain on university budgets, limiting the resources available for crucial investments in infrastructure, student support services, and other initiatives that enhance the overall quality of education. By reducing or eliminating tenure, universities would have greater flexibility to allocate their resources more strategically, better serving the needs of students and society as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, while the concept of tenure may have served a valuable purpose in the past, it is now a relic of a bygone era.

        "argument": "Banning gas car sales too soon would be premature and unrealistic given the current state of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. While EVs have made great strides in recent years, they still only make up around 5% of new car sales in the U.S.\n\nThe average sticker price for an electric car is over $10,000 higher than a comparable gas-powered vehicle, putting them out of reach for many middle and working class families. Battery range and charging times also remain significant obstacles - the majority of affordable EVs have a range under 250 miles, and even fast charging still takes 30-60 minutes compared to a few minutes to fill up a gas tank.\n\nPublic charging infrastructure, while expanding, is still sparse in many areas of the country.

This undermines meritocracy and denies opportunities to talented, energetic young scholars who could breathe new life into our universities. Reforming or eliminating tenure would inject much-needed dynamism and accountability into the system, ensuring that only the most productive and effective professors are retained and rewarded.\n\nFinally, the financial burden of tenured faculty salaries and benefits places a significant strain on university budgets, limiting the resources available for crucial investments in infrastructure, student support services, and other initiatives that enhance the overall quality of education.

While tenure was originally intended to protect academic freedom and promote rigorous research and scholarship, in practice it has become a barrier to progress and a hindrance to the evolution of our universities.\n\nFirstly, the current tenure system insulates professors from the need to continually prove their worth and relevance. Once granted tenure, many professors become complacent, content to coast on their past achievements rather than pushing the boundaries of their fields or adapting to changing student needs and market demands. This stifles innovation, limits the introduction of new ideas and teaching methods, and ultimately fails to serve the best interests of students, who are the lifeblood of our higher education system.\n\nFurthermore, the tenure process is often opaque and subject to bias, with personal connections and politics playing an outsized role in determining which professors receive this coveted status. This undermines meritocracy and denies opportunities to talented, energetic young scholars who could breathe new life into our universities. Reforming or eliminating tenure would inject much-needed dynamism and accountability into the system, ensuring that only the most productive and effective professors are retained and rewarded.\n\nFinally, the financial burden of tenured faculty salaries and benefits places a significant strain on university budgets, limiting the resources available for crucial investments in infrastructure, student support services, and other initiatives that enhance the overall quality of education. By reducing or eliminating tenure, universities would have greater flexibility to allocate their resources more strategically, better serving the needs of students and society as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, while the concept of tenure may have served a valuable purpose in the past, it is now a relic of a bygone era. By reforming or eliminating this outdated system, we can unlock the full potential of our universities, fostering a culture of innovation, accountability, and excellence that better prepares our students for the challenges of the 21st century.",

        "argument": "Prescription drug ads on television are a growing concern that need to be addressed. These ads have become increasingly prevalent in recent years, with the United States and New Zealand being the only two countries in the world that allow direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medications. While the pharmaceutical industry claims that these ads empower patients and promote disease awareness, the reality is that they pose significant risks to public health and should be banned from television.\n\nOne of the primary issues with prescription drug ads is that they frequently downplay or gloss over the potential side effects and risks associated with these medications. The fast-paced, visually appealing nature of these ads often overshadows the fine print disclaimers, leading viewers to underestimate the dangers. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that over 60% of prescription drug ads fail to adequately convey the risks and side effects of the medications they promote.\n\nFurthermore, these ads have been shown to drive up healthcare costs by encouraging patients to request brand-name drugs, even when generic or alternative treatments may be more appropriate and affordable. A report by the National Institutes of Health estimated that direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs increases overall healthcare spending by $30 billion per year in the United States alone.\n\nUltimately, the potential harms of prescription drug ads on television outweigh any purported benefits. By banning these ads, we can protect public health, promote more responsible and ethical pharmaceutical marketing practices, and reduce the financial burden on the healthcare system. For these reasons, prescription drug ads should no longer be allowed on television.",

A simple knowledge test, similar to a driver's license exam, would ensure that pilots understand the rules, airspace restrictions, and safe operating procedures before being allowed to fly. Studies show that 80% of drone incidents are caused by untrained or uninformed pilots.\nWhile some argue these requirements infringe on personal freedom, the reality is that any vehicle capable of causing harm must be regulated for public safety, just like cars, boats and planes. No one's recreation should come at the cost of putting others at risk. Nine states have already implemented mandatory registration and four require a basic written test, proving these are reasonable, enforceable measures. For the safety of our shared airspace and communities, recreational drone operators should be licensed to fly only after being registered and demonstrating a standard level of competence and responsibility.",
