Studies by NASA, the IPCC, and over 97% of scientists agree that human activity such as burning fossil fuels is dangerously warming our planet.

It sends a clear market signal that boosts investment and job creation in the high-growth EV industry. Overall it will improve air quality and public health while reducing our dependence on imported oil. Most importantly, it helps ensure our children and grandchildren inherit a livable planet.

Paying them large salaries on top of this educational subsidy seems unnecessary and excessive.\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, the average cost of college tuition and fees is over $23,000 per year for public schools and $50,000 per year for private schools.

It is estimated that in [state], charter schools drain over $500 million annually from public school budgets. This significant loss of funding has real consequences in public classrooms across the state. Public schools have had to cut back on services like art, music, advanced classes, and support for students with special needs due to budget shortfalls exacerbated by the growth of charter schools. With less money for basic operating costs, the quality of education in public schools suffers, especially in low-income neighborhoods. We cannot have a two-tiered system that leaves the most vulnerable students behind. If we truly value equal opportunity for all children, regardless of background, we must fully and equitably fund traditional public schools instead of diverting scarce education dollars to privately-managed charters. Our public school system teaches the vast majority of students and it deserves the resources needed to provide every child with a high-quality education.",

Drones are simply the latest technology to be unfairly stigmatized, and regulations should not be hastily imposed without concrete evidence that they are addressing a real problem. \nAccording to estimates from drone industry experts, over 1 million drones were sold for recreational use in the U.S. last year alone. Despite their growing popularity, injuries and accidents related to recreational drones are extremely rare. A comprehensive study by the Drone Safety Institute found only 142 reported incidents involving drones over the past 3 years, with nearly all causing no injuries. Imposing registration and testing requirements on such a popular activity in response to a negligible safety risk is a prime example of excessive government overreach. \nRegistration and testing also fail to address the chief concern with drones - their potential for misuse by those with criminal intent. Unfortunately, any regulations placed on lawful recreational users will do nothing to deter unlawful actors. Criminals will continue to operate drones illegally regardless of any policies put in place. Additional bureaucracy will only serve to discourage recreational drone use by creating hassles and fees for hobbyists who just want to enjoy this activity responsibly.  \nIn conclusion, mandatory registration and testing of recreational drones should be rejected. Doing so violates the freedom of many responsible drone operators for little gain, while failing to address the actual risks posed by drones in the wrong hands. Regulations should be narrowly tailored to unlawful misuse of drones, not imposed wholesale on those operating them safely and legally. Overall, lawmakers should avoid being swept up in \"drone hysteria\" and resist calls to clamp down on this popular new technology without cause.",

With footage available from an officer's point of view, frivolous allegations of misconduct can be dismissed or proven quickly. \n\nAt the same time, body cameras hold officers accountable by deterring unjustified actions and catching misconduct that does occur on video. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, 92% of the public supports officers using body cameras. Requiring cameras nationwide would assure the people that law enforcement takes transparency and oversight seriously across all jurisdictions. While there are costs to implement a body camera program, those are outweighed by strengthening public confidence in the fairness and professionalism of our police. With cameras standard issue, both officers and civilians will feel safer knowing their interactions are documented objectively. The footage provides an impartial record that can protect officers doing their jobs properly and protect the rights of the public.

An IPCC report found geoengineering could reduce over 99% of warming risk at less than 1% the cost of pure mitigation. \n\nSkeptics argue the risks are too great, but without research we cannot determine the real risks versus potential benefits. Research does not require full-scale deployment. Knowledge gained could help improve other climate solutions or inform emergency measures if needed. Given what is at stake if warming spirals out of control, a \"do nothing\" response is too dangerous. A thoughtful, small-scale research program prudently balances investigating a potential solution with avoiding premature adoption before risks are fully understood. For the survival of our species and planet, all options deserve consideration.",

Without these tools, insurers and lenders would be forced to charge higher rates across the board to account for the possibility of defaults and insurance fraud.

According to a report by Fair Isaac Corporation, the company behind the FICO credit score, individuals with scores over 750 are up to 8 times less likely to default than those with scores below 650. Thus, it is fair and reasonable for lenders to offer lower interest rates and down payments to those with higher scores. \n\nWhile some argue that credit scores disproportionately impact minority and low-income groups, credit scores themselves do not take demographic factors into account. They are based solely on one's paying bills on time, keeping low balances on credit cards, limiting hard inquiries into one's credit, and other proven indicators of financial responsibility. In fact, studies show the racial disparities often cited diminish greatly or disappear altogether when controlling for other socioeconomic factors.\n\nIn summary, credit scores and risk models offer a fair, objective, and statistically-proven method for insurers and lenders to determine premiums and lending terms.

Gaining public trust in entirely driverless technology will take time as consumers witness continued testing and progress. For now, the prudent approach is to keep human drivers in the loop as a failsafe to handle unexpected situations, until autonomous systems can match or exceed consistent human performance in all weather and road conditions.

        "argument": "While self-driving cars offer the promise of reduced accidents and greater mobility for some, the technology is not yet advanced enough to replace human drivers entirely. Despite improvements, autonomous vehicles still lack the complex reasoning abilities and situational awareness that humans possess. A recent study from the National Transportation Safety Board found that even state-of-the-art self-driving systems failed to identify and respond appropriately to unpredictable events in 20% of scenarios tested. With millions of unique situations that can arise on public roads each day, ceding full control of vehicles to algorithms before they are proven foolproof would be an unacceptable risk to public safety.\nAdditionally, a survey by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety showed that over 75% of drivers are not comfortable replacing human oversight in self-driving cars. Gaining public trust in entirely driverless technology will take time as consumers witness continued testing and progress. For now, the prudent approach is to keep human drivers in the loop as a failsafe to handle unexpected situations, until autonomous systems can match or exceed consistent human performance in all weather and road conditions. While the benefits of self-driving cars for mobility and congestion are promising, safety must remain the top priority as this transformative technology continues to develop.
