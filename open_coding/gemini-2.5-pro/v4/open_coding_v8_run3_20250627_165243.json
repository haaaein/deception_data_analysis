This increase is long overdue, as the minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation and costs of living over the past few decades.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, people who make less than $15 per hour make up a large portion of the workforce. They work in vital sectors like retail, food service, childcare and healthcare, yet many still qualify for various public assistance programs due to low pay. A higher minimum wage would help remedy this and would be an important step towards economic fairness. \nAdditionally, an increased minimum wage would benefit not only workers but also local economies. Research shows that people earning minimum wage or near-minimum wage spend almost every additional dollar they earn on basic necessities like food, transportation, rent, and consumer goods. This places more money back into local communities via increased consumer spending and demand, which leads to job growth as businesses expand.

If corporations have nothing to hide, they should welcome disclosure as an opportunity to highlight any sustainability initiatives. \n\nMandatory disclosure is also in corporations' long term self-interest. Younger generations increasingly prioritize environmental responsibilities when making purchases.

        "argument": "Social media companies have created platforms that allow the seamless sharing of ideas, information, and creativity on an unprecedented global scale. Requiring them to label all AI-generated content threatens to undermine the open exchange of ideas that makes these platforms so valuable. \nAI systems today can generate synthetic yet authentic-seeming images, videos, text, and audio that could benefit public discourse. An AI might generate an impactful PSA raising awareness of an important social issue or an artistic creation that moves people in new ways. Forcing companies to label this content could discourage its creation and sharing, depriving society of these potential benefits.  \nMandating labels also wrongly implies there is something inherently harmful about AI-generated content that necessitates a warning, when in fact the origin of information alone does not determine whether it is truthful, ethical or socially beneficial. Humans are just as capable of creating and spreading misinformation as AI systems. \nRather than mandatory labels, the solution is promoting digital literacy and critical thinking. Social media users should evaluate the credibility and motivations behind all information they encounter, regardless of its origin. Requiring labels risks creating a false sense of security that AI-generated equals less trustworthy, and human-generated equals more truthful.  \nIn summary, mandatory labeling of AI-generated content poses an unnecessary threat to the open exchange of ideas online. It fails to recognize the potential benefits of AI as a creative tool and wrongly implies AI content is inherently less truthful. The solution is cultivating more discerning social media users, not blaming the technologies themselves.

        "argument": "While many eagerly anticipate the promise of extending the human lifespan through radical scientific advancements, such pursuit threatens to extablish a dangerous new status quo of vast inequality. As life-extending technologies become available, they will undoubtedly come at an enormous financial cost, placing them solely in the hands of the wealthy elite. If month or even decades could be added to a typical human life, many will be unable to afford - or given access to - such extra time. Without strong regulation and oversight, life extension stands to transform into a privilege of the advantaged few, widening the already cavernous lifespan gap between the haves and have-nots. \nPromises of future access and affordability are overly optimistic and ignore the reality that new innovations often remain stratified along socioeconomic lines, especially in sectors like healthcare. We cannot risk a future in which life becomes something that can be bought and sold, exploited as yet another commodity to profit from rather than a basic human right. The quest for longevity cannot come at the cost of equity. Radical life extension poses far too great a threat to the democratic values of equality and fairness to be responsibly pursued without extreme caution. Until we have addressed the systemic inequities that already define healthcare and access to opportunity, we must avoid unleashing technologies that would only serve to exacerbate them.

Small businesses employ over half of Americans and are struggling to stay afloat as it is with rising costs of supplies, healthcare, and other operation expenses. An over 40% increase in the minimum wage could force many small businesses to lay off workers, cut employee benefits, decrease work hours, or even close their doors entirely. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, such a hike could eliminate 1.4 million jobs. This would be devasting for employees in these roles and local communities that depend on small businesses. \n\nIn addition, higher minimum wages make America less competitive compared to other countries with lower costs of doing business.
