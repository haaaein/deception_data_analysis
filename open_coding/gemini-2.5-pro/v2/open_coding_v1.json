Clearly, the technology has yet to catch up with the hype.\n\nMoreover, cybersecurity risks give experts pause. Self-driving cars could be vulnerable to hacking, endangering passengers. One study found that just a few bits of code could confuse a car's AI into crashing. We cannot entrust our lives to such fragile technology.\n\nProponents note that autonomous vehicles will revolutionize mobility for the elderly and people with disabilities. But limited self-driving capabilities can improve accessibility without full automation. Let's embrace helpful applications while continuing to rely on human oversight for true safety.\n\nRushing to adopt self-driving cars prematurely risks lives. They can serve as assistants, but artificial intelligence lacks human judgment. Until self-driving cars can reliably handle all driving scenarios, human drivers must remain in control. When it comes to public safety, we should favor prudence over speculation.",

        "argument": "Allowing prescription drug importation would provide a vital lifeline for millions of Americans struggling to afford the medications they desperately need. A 2020 study by the RAND Corporation found that U.S. prescription drug prices are nearly 2.5 times higher on average than in 32 other developed countries. As a result, as many as 1 in 4 Americans report difficulty paying for their prescriptions.\nImportation would enable these patients to legally and safely access the same drugs at much lower prices from legitimate pharmacies in countries like Canada, where the government negotiates more reasonable drug costs on behalf of its citizens. Claims that imported drugs are dangerous are baseless fearmongering - the FDA could easily regulate and inspect foreign pharmacies to ensure drug safety and efficacy, just as it already does for the 40% of U.S. drugs made overseas.\nWhat's more, increasing competition from imported drugs would force U.S. pharmaceutical companies to lower prices here at home to stay competitive.

        "argument": "In the face of rising costs, increasing demands for accountability, and the need to maintain a dynamic, responsive, and innovative higher education system, the traditional system of tenure for university professors must be reformed or eliminated. While tenure was originally intended to protect academic freedom and promote rigorous research and scholarship, in practice it has become a barrier to progress and a hindrance to the evolution of our universities.\n\nFirstly, the current tenure system insulates professors from the need to continually prove their worth and relevance. Once granted tenure, many professors become complacent, content to coast on their past achievements rather than pushing the boundaries of their fields or adapting to changing student needs and market demands.

While EVs have made great strides in recent years, they still only make up around 5% of new car sales in the U.S.\n\nThe average sticker price for an electric car is over $10,000 higher than a comparable gas-powered vehicle, putting them out of reach for many middle and working class families.

While tenure was originally intended to protect academic freedom and promote rigorous research and scholarship, in practice it has become a barrier to progress and a hindrance to the evolution of our universities.\n\nFirstly, the current tenure system insulates professors from the need to continually prove their worth and relevance. Once granted tenure, many professors become complacent, content to coast on their past achievements rather than pushing the boundaries of their fields or adapting to changing student needs and market demands. This stifles innovation, limits the introduction of new ideas and teaching methods, and ultimately fails to serve the best interests of students, who are the lifeblood of our higher education system.\n\nFurthermore, the tenure process is often opaque and subject to bias, with personal connections and politics playing an outsized role in determining which professors receive this coveted status. This undermines meritocracy and denies opportunities to talented, energetic young scholars who could breathe new life into our universities. Reforming or eliminating tenure would inject much-needed dynamism and accountability into the system, ensuring that only the most productive and effective professors are retained and rewarded.\n\nFinally, the financial burden of tenured faculty salaries and benefits places a significant strain on university budgets, limiting the resources available for crucial investments in infrastructure, student support services, and other initiatives that enhance the overall quality of education. By reducing or eliminating tenure, universities would have greater flexibility to allocate their resources more strategically, better serving the needs of students and society as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, while the concept of tenure may have served a valuable purpose in the past, it is now a relic of a bygone era.

While tenure was originally intended to protect academic freedom and promote rigorous research and scholarship, in practice it has become a barrier to progress and a hindrance to the evolution of our universities.\n\nFirstly, the current tenure system insulates professors from the need to continually prove their worth and relevance. Once granted tenure, many professors become complacent, content to coast on their past achievements rather than pushing the boundaries of their fields or adapting to changing student needs and market demands. This stifles innovation, limits the introduction of new ideas and teaching methods, and ultimately fails to serve the best interests of students, who are the lifeblood of our higher education system.\n\nFurthermore, the tenure process is often opaque and subject to bias, with personal connections and politics playing an outsized role in determining which professors receive this coveted status. This undermines meritocracy and denies opportunities to talented, energetic young scholars who could breathe new life into our universities. Reforming or eliminating tenure would inject much-needed dynamism and accountability into the system, ensuring that only the most productive and effective professors are retained and rewarded.\n\nFinally, the financial burden of tenured faculty salaries and benefits places a significant strain on university budgets, limiting the resources available for crucial investments in infrastructure, student support services, and other initiatives that enhance the overall quality of education.

        "argument": "Charter schools offer a much-needed alternative to traditional public schools and help drive innovation in education. By providing competition and expanding options for families, especially in underserved communities, charter schools incentivize all schools to improve in order to attract and retain students.\n\nA Stanford University study found that students in urban charter schools gained the equivalent of 40 additional days of learning in math and 28 extra days in reading per year compared to their peers in traditional public schools. Charters have more flexibility to experiment with new teaching methods, curricula, school hours, and education technology. The most successful innovations can then spread and influence the wider public school system.\n\nFor example, Summit Public Schools, a high-performing charter network in California and Washington, developed a personalized learning platform now used by over 400 district and charter schools nationwide, impacting tens of thousands of students. KIPP, IDEA Public Schools, Success Academy and other top charter organizations have also pioneered effective new education models.\n\nWhile not every charter succeeds, the beauty is that failing charters can be closed down, while failing district schools often endure. Charters are also held accountable by the families who can leave if unsatisfied. With over 3 million students now attending 7500+ charter schools nationwide, it's clear that public charters are a vital part of the solution to America's education challenges in the 21st century. We should continue to support their responsible growth and replication of the most effective models.",

Banning such ads would mean less misinformation and more educated patients.\n\nFinally, doctors are better equipped than pharma companies to determine the best treatments for their patients. TV ads encourage patients to pressure doctors for new pills, even when their current treatment is adequate. We are better off leaving complex medical decisions to medical professionals, not profit-driven drug companies.  \n\nIn summary, drug ads on TV benefit Big Pharma far more than patients and society. For the sake of public health and lower healthcare costs, it is time to take direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising off the air.",
