        "argument": "Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have become a central part of public discourse and information sharing in modern society. With great power comes great responsibility. As private companies, they have a moral duty to consider the impact their platforms have and to take reasonable steps to prevent demonstrable harm.\nResearch from Harvard, MIT, and the University of Oxford shows that unchecked toxic content on social media disproportionately impacts more vulnerable groups like minorities and fosters a hostile online climate that spills over into the real world. According to studies published in leading scientific journals, exposure to certain types of hateful, conspiratorial, or harmful speech on social platforms correlates with increased levels of anxiety, depression, and even violent radicalization in some cases.  \nWhile censorship should always be an approach of last resort, moderating the most blatant objectionable content is reasonable and necessary.

Initial entrepreneur-led flights will carry professionals trained to accept higher risk, not general tourists. Moreover, international guidelines for informed consent already protect passengers. Allowing these test flights now under flexible \"learning phase\" rules could generate crucial safety data faster, as emerging issues are identified and voluntarily addressed ahead of larger-scale operations. \n\nWith cooperation between private industry and regulatory bodies, reasonable safety advances can be achieved without halting innovation or the inspiring socioeconomic potential of this frontier. Rather than reacting fearfully to hypothetical dangers, a balanced approach balancing learning with protection could help lead humanity to explore space sustainably and for the benefit of all. The time has come for progress and not delay.",

Government oversight may even boost public trust in and enthusiasm for space tourism.\n\nUntil comprehensive regulations for training, equipment, medical standards and more are established, space tourism should not be open for business. The rewards of venturing into the final frontier must not come at the cost of human life. By taking the proper precautions and learning from the successes of commercial aviation, space tourism can one day become as routine as air travel. But we must get it right the first time. Lives depend on it.",

Requiring social media companies to clearly label AI-generated content would help address this threat through transparency.\nResearch shows that unlabeled synthetic media is often mistaken as authentic by many users. As Deepfakes and other manipulated media become more sophisticated, it will become increasingly difficult for average people to distinguish real from fake without some indication. This could allow the intentional spread of misinformation to influence opinions and events. \nHowever, simply labeling AI content will not unduly limit free expression or create burdensome oversight.

Studies by NASA, the IPCC, and over 97% of scientists agree that human activity such as burning fossil fuels is dangerously warming our planet. If we do not take decisive action now, the consequences for future generations and global stability will be severe.\nBanning new gas car sales after a set transition period is a reasonable step that balances economic and environmental needs. By choosing a future cutoff date, like 2035, it gives automakers time to gradually shift production and consumers to purchase more sustainable electric vehicles as that market expands and prices drop. Major companies are already moving in that direction, recognizing the coming changes. With continued technological progress, many analysts believe EVs will reach price parity with gas cars within the next decade.  \nPutting the phase-out in motion will also drive further innovation. It sends a clear market signal that boosts investment and job creation in the high-growth EV industry. Overall it will improve air quality and public health while reducing our dependence on imported oil. Most importantly, it helps ensure our children and grandchildren inherit a livable planet. A ban with a reasonable transition period is a small sacrifice for the sake of future generations. Our climate cannot afford further delay or half-measures.

According to recent studies by economists at Harvard and MIT, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would lift pay for tens of millions of American workers without costing jobs. This increase is long overdue, as the minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation and costs of living over the past few decades.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, people who make less than $15 per hour make up a large portion of the workforce. They work in vital sectors like retail, food service, childcare and healthcare, yet many still qualify for various public assistance programs due to low pay. A higher minimum wage would help remedy this and would be an important step towards economic fairness. \nAdditionally, an increased minimum wage would benefit not only workers but also local economies. Research shows that people earning minimum wage or near-minimum wage spend almost every additional dollar they earn on basic necessities like food, transportation, rent, and consumer goods. This places more money back into local communities via increased consumer spending and demand, which leads to job growth as businesses expand. Raising the minimum wage to $15 nationwide would provide more economic security for millions of working Americans while stimulating broader economic activity that benefits everyone. It is in our shared interests to support this necessary policy change.",

This is quite low when compared to traditional aviation activities.\nRather than punishing the vast majority of responsible drone pilots with new regulations, the FAA would be better served focusing enforcement efforts on the small number of bad actors flying irresponsibly. Restrictions should be a last resort. A better approach is to promote safer flying practices through education. Many pilots groups already provide free online training and tips for safe operation without government mandates.\nUltimately, recreational drone flying should remain an accessible hobby that inspires future innovators.

        "argument": "While many eagerly anticipate the promise of extending the human lifespan through radical scientific advancements, such pursuit threatens to extablish a dangerous new status quo of vast inequality. As life-extending technologies become available, they will undoubtedly come at an enormous financial cost, placing them solely in the hands of the wealthy elite. If month or even decades could be added to a typical human life, many will be unable to afford - or given access to - such extra time. Without strong regulation and oversight, life extension stands to transform into a privilege of the advantaged few, widening the already cavernous lifespan gap between the haves and have-nots. \nPromises of future access and affordability are overly optimistic and ignore the reality that new innovations often remain stratified along socioeconomic lines, especially in sectors like healthcare. We cannot risk a future in which life becomes something that can be bought and sold, exploited as yet another commodity to profit from rather than a basic human right. The quest for longevity cannot come at the cost of equity. Radical life extension poses far too great a threat to the democratic values of equality and fairness to be responsibly pursued without extreme caution. Until we have addressed the systemic inequities that already define healthcare and access to opportunity, we must avoid unleashing technologies that would only serve to exacerbate them.

It may also incentivize companies to improve their AI systems to generate more authentic and ethical creative works.\n\nWhile some argue that mandatory labeling places an undue burden on tech companies, the scale of resources and data that platforms have access to means they are best positioned to develop AI detection methods. They also have a responsibility to users to provide information about how their platforms work. The EU, UK, and others have passed or proposed similar laws around AI system transparency with no major issues. Overall, labeling AI-generated content is a reasonable ask that balances innovation and oversight. Social media companies should willingly take this step to maintain user trust, but regulations may be needed to hold them accountable if they do not.",
