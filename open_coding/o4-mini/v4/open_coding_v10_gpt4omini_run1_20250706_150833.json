By promoting awareness and doctor-patient conversations about medical conditions and treatment options, these ads have the potential to benefit public health. For these reasons, prescription drug advertising should be broadly allowed and encouraged.",

Allowing salaries risks turning our beloved college teams into minor leagues, prioritizing wins and revenues over education. \n\nStatistics show that less than 2% of college athletes go on to play professionally. For the other 98%, their scholarship is providing a life-changing educational opportunity that often wouldn't be possible otherwise. Paid salaries risk pushing athletes' focus away from academics and toward chasing paychecks instead of diplomas. This could diminish the college experience for all students. \n\nAdditionally, unlimited salaries could drastically increase costs for universities. According to the NCAA, average spending per athlete already exceeds $100 thousand annually at FBS schools. Introducing salaries on top of this could strain university budgets and cut non-revenue sports that don'tgenerate revenue. Fewer students would have the chance to compete and fewer would have their education funded. \n\nLet's continue supporting student-athletes through scholarships and stipends instead of risking the integrity of collegiate sports. Preserving amateurism ensures the focus stays on education first while still allowing talented athletes to develop their skills. This balanced approach benefits both athletes and universities for years to come.",

Requiring corporations to report on their greenhouse gas emissions and climate change risks is necessary for creating a sustainable future for our planet.\n\nAccording to a recent report, just 100 companies have been responsible for over 70% of industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. The vast majority of these emissions have been undisclosed, preventing policymakers and the public from having a full grasp of companies' climate impacts or holding them accountable. Mandatory climate impact disclosures would force companies to become transparent about risks they are creating for our environment and society. \n\nWith increased transparency, investors and consumers could direct their money toward sustainable, eco-friendly companies. This market pressure would motivate more companies to transition to renewable energy and environmentally-friendly practices. Overall, mandatory climate impact disclosures have the potential to drastically curb carbon emissions and limit the catastrophic consequences of climate change. \n\nCritics argue that mandatory reporting creates an unnecessary bureaucratic burden, but the existential threat of climate change far outweighs any minor costs to businesses. While some companies may have to make initial investments to accurately track and disclose emissions data, ensuring a livable planet for future generations is worth any short-term sacrifices. \n\nIn conclusion, corporations have a clear responsibility to provide information about how their operations affect climate change. Requiring the disclosure of climate impacts would drive companies to make more sustainable choices, enabling investors and consumers to support those choices. The future of our planet depends on transparency and accountability from the companies that fuel environmental destruction. Overall, mandatory climate impact disclosures should be implemented immediately to secure a sustainable future for our planet.",

        "argument": "College athletes are contributing enormously to their universities, yet receive no compensation for their work. These athletes, many of whom come from underprivileged backgrounds, generate billions of dollars in revenue for universities but struggle financially themselves after graduating. Paying college athletes fair salaries would help address the extreme inequality of this system.  \nA recent study found Division I football and basketball players generate over $10 billion in revenue for universities and third parties. Meanwhile, these athletes receive scholarships that cover only a fraction of the full cost of attendance and often struggle to pay for essentials like food, transportation and healthcare. After graduating, many former athletes face health issues from their time playing, have no career to fall back on, and live below the poverty line. This imbalance is unjust and amounts to the unfair exploitation of athletes for their labor and talent.  \nProviding college athletes fair pay for their work would help remedy these inequities. Salaries of just $45,000 per year could lift many athletes out of poverty, provide them essential resources during college, and help them build better lives after graduating with degrees. Paying athletes would also encourage them to stay in school longer and graduate, whereas currently many leave early for professional leagues to earn money. \nCollege sports generate billions in profit, but the athletes producing that value receive none of it. Paying college athletes salaries is simply the fair and ethical thing to do. When universities profit so greatly from students’ work, those students deserve to share in that success. College athletes should be paid.",

        "argument": "While some argue that using credit scores and risk models raises equity concerns, these tools actually enable insurers and lenders to offer fairer rates to all customers. By taking on greater risk, those with lower credit are understandably charged higher premiums or interest - but are still given access that might otherwise be denied. At the same time, responsible customers see savings through lower costs.  \nStatistical analyses by the Federal Reserve Bank and independent review panels have found these models to be highly predictive of risk without factors like gender, race, or income - ensuring fairness. In fact, a University of Chicago study showed rates would rise over 15% industry-wide without these tools, disproportionately harming lower-income communities.\nRather than prejudice, credit scores reflect each person's proven record managing finances and commitments over time. Though challenging for some, building a good credit history is within anyone's control through diligent payment of bills. By evaluating individual circumstances and choices objectively, insurers and lenders can serve all customers fairly at costs we all benefit from. Overall, an equitable and inclusive system results from using risk-based pricing that has withstood rigorous review.",

They can also be easily confused by unexpected obstacles like construction zones, emergency vehicles, or complicated intersections.   Researchers at Stanford found that self-driving cars took up to 10 times longer than human drivers to navigate complicated intersections, putting other drivers and pedestrians in danger.\nWhile proponents argue self-driving cars will ultimately reduce accidents, prematurely putting self-driving cars on the roads could lead to a sharp increase in crashes that lead to injury or death.

With proper parental controls and guidance on responsible use, technology does not have to be harmful and can support healthy development.  \n\nWhile concerns about technology addiction, cyberbullying, and privacy issues are valid, banning technology is not the solution and will likely just encourage kids to circumvent rules to use devices in secret. Instead, parents should have open conversations with their kids about responsible technology use and set reasonable limits and boundaries.

This would save thousands of lives each year in the United States alone.\n\nAccording to a recent study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, over 90% of car crashes are caused by human error such as distracted driving, drunken driving, or fatigue. Self-driving cars, programmed by engineers to drive safely and defensively at all times, could virtually eliminate these types of accidents. They would never drive aggressively, tailgate, or look at their phones while in motion. This would not only reduce traffic fatalities but also lessen congestion from accidents that block roads. \n\nAs autonomous technology continues advancing quickly, within 5 years self-driving cars may be able to handle most driving scenarios better than humans. They could provide mobility for the elderly and disabled, who often cannot drive themselves. Widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles would allow people to work, read, or relax instead of focus on driving - making Commutes and road trips much more productive. While transitioning will require oversight and adjustments, self-driving cars will soon offer too many safety, mobility and economic benefits to ignore. The future of transportation is automated, and we should embrace this inevitable progress to save lives and improve our communities.",
