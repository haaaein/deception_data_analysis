However, despite the hype surrounding charters, the evidence shows they do far more harm than good by diverting funds away from traditional public schools. According to a recent study by Education Analytics, charter schools receive on average 30% more in public funding per student compared to traditional public schools. This amounts to over $150M each year that is siphoned away from public schools in our state alone. \n\nPublic schools, which educate 90% of students, rely on consistent funding to provide essential services. Shortchanging them of funds threatens programs like free lunch, bus transportation, and extracurricular activities that foster students' development and support disadvantaged families. Meanwhile, charter schools are subject to far less oversight and accountability regarding how they spend public money. A shocking report last year found that nearly half of charter school funds go to \"administrative costs\" like exorbitant executive salaries, not the classroom. \n\nRather than invest in a parallel system of charter schools, we should fully fund public schools to provide smaller class sizes, more counseling and technology resources, higher teacher pay, and relevant curriculum. When public schools thrive, students thrive. While the ideals behind charter schools are noble, the reality is they weaken the entire public education system. It's time to recognize that separate is not equal. Our students deserve well-funded schools that prioritize their needs over profits and politics. Public money should go to public schools.",

        "argument": "Social media platforms have grown into the dominant modes of communication in our increasingly digital world. Hundreds of millions of people use platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to connect with friends, share ideas, and engage in public discourse. However, these companies have gradually increased their censorship of legal speech on their platforms, removing or restricting content they deem \"offensive\" or against their policies. \nWhile the companies are within their rights as private entities to set these policies, excessive censorship threatens free expression and the open exchange of ideas that have come to define these platforms. A 2019 study found over 2.5 million posts were censored by Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube - an enormous volume of speech erased from public view. When platforms censor too much legal content, they risk becoming echo chambers that only allow ideas approved by the companies.  \nMore speech, not less, is the solution to ideas some may find offensive. Censorship should be an absolute last resort for illegality, not a tool to enforce subjective standards of acceptability. If someone encounters an idea they disagree with, the appropriate response is to engage in open debate and discussion, not demand that the idea be removed from view. \nSocial media has given more people a voice and platform for sharing ideas than ever before. We must defend the ability to freely exchange ideas - even legal speech some may not like - or risk losing the openness that has allowed these platforms to thrive. Legal speech should not be censored, no matter how objectionable some may find it. Our society depends on the free flow of ideas, and censorship threatens progress by limiting discussion, debate, and the spread of knowledge. For these reasons, social media companies should avoid censoring legal speech and trust in free expression.",

By using personalized risk scores, they can offer lower rates to those with a proven history of financial responsibility.\n\nCredit scores have been shown by extensive research to be strongly correlated with a person's risk of defaulting on a loan or other financial obligation. According to a report by Fair Isaac Corporation, the company behind the FICO credit score, individuals with scores over 750 are up to 8 times less likely to default than those with scores below 650. Thus, it is fair and reasonable for lenders to offer lower interest rates and down payments to those with higher scores. \n\nWhile some argue that credit scores disproportionately impact minority and low-income groups, credit scores themselves do not take demographic factors into account. They are based solely on one's paying bills on time, keeping low balances on credit cards, limiting hard inquiries into one's credit, and other proven indicators of financial responsibility. In fact, studies show the racial disparities often cited diminish greatly or disappear altogether when controlling for other socioeconomic factors.\n\nIn summary, credit scores and risk models offer a fair, objective, and statistically-proven method for insurers and lenders to determine premiums and lending terms. By using these tools, they can offer better rates to lower-risk customers, expanding access to affordable credit and insurance for those who have demonstrated financial responsibility.",

        "argument": "While some argue that using credit scores and risk models raises equity concerns, these tools actually enable insurers and lenders to offer fairer rates to all customers. By taking on greater risk, those with lower credit are understandably charged higher premiums or interest - but are still given access that might otherwise be denied. At the same time, responsible customers see savings through lower costs.  \nStatistical analyses by the Federal Reserve Bank and independent review panels have found these models to be highly predictive of risk without factors like gender, race, or income - ensuring fairness. In fact, a University of Chicago study showed rates would rise over 15% industry-wide without these tools, disproportionately harming lower-income communities.\nRather than prejudice, credit scores reflect each person's proven record managing finances and commitments over time. Though challenging for some, building a good credit history is within anyone's control through diligent payment of bills. By evaluating individual circumstances and choices objectively, insurers and lenders can serve all customers fairly at costs we all benefit from. Overall, an equitable and inclusive system results from using risk-based pricing that has withstood rigorous review.",

This would be devasting for employees in these roles and local communities that depend on small businesses. \n\nIn addition, higher minimum wages make America less competitive compared to other countries with lower costs of doing business. If major corporations are mandated to pay higher wages, many will automate positions currently held by lower-skilled workers or move jobs overseas where labor is cheaper. This could lead to fewer job opportunities for those without higher education. Furthermore, research from the University of Washington shows that higher minimum wages do little to actually help lift families out of poverty in the long-run. Workers adjust their spending to make up for higher wages, negating much of the intended assistance. \n\nWhile advocates argue higher pay will stimulate the economy, the costs would overwhelmingly hurt small companies and many low-income employees.
