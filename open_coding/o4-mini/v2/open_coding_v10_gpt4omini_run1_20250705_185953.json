Body cameras provide an objective record of interactions between officers and civilians that can resolve disputes and protect both parties.

According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, 92% of the public supports officers using body cameras. Requiring cameras nationwide would assure the people that law enforcement takes transparency and oversight seriously across all jurisdictions. While there are costs to implement a body camera program, those are outweighed by strengthening public confidence in the fairness and professionalism of our police. With cameras standard issue, both officers and civilians will feel safer knowing their interactions are documented objectively.

Regulations that are too prescriptive risk being counterproductive.\n\nCorporate leaders are increasingly recognizing the business case for sustainable practices that lower long-term costs through efficiency gains. According to data from Sustainalytics, over 80% of major companies have already committed to cutting emissions or using renewable energy without being forced to do so. With growing consumer and shareholder demand for climate accountability, the private sector has strong incentive to reduce its footprint and disclose improvements transparently. \n\nAdditional regulatory oversight could undermine this positive momentum by reducing autonomy and innovation. A collaborative, results-oriented framework in which companies set and track their own goals would be more effective at achieving climate progress while keeping America's economic engine running at full speed. Overall environmental and social welfare are best served by cooperative, incentive-based solutions rather than top-down dictates and red tape.",

However, this is an unrealistic and unfeasible goal that most countries do not have the infrastructure or funds to achieve. \nMore importantly, internet access is not essential for human survival and well-being in the way that access to food, water, shelter, and healthcare are. While the internet has become an important part of how we communicate and access information, it is still possible to live a safe, productive, and fulfilling life without constant connectivity. Many leaders, scientists, and thinkers throughout history did not have access to the internet and were still able to greatly impact the world.\nSome proponents argue that internet access should be a right because it enables access to information and facilitates civic engagement. However, public libraries, community centers, and schools can provide access to information and resources for those without their own connectivity. Civic participation also does not require constant internet access and there are many ways to stay engaged in the community offline.  \nIn conclusion, while internet access has significant benefits, it should not be classified as a basic human right. Access is not necessary for human survival and well-being, and not feasible for most governments and societies to provide universally. Public resources can fill the gaps for those without connectivity, and civic participation can thrive offline. It is a privilege, not a right.",

Rising fuel efficiency standards, tax credits for electric vehicles, and increased investment in public charging infrastructure can all help accelerate consumer adoption of EVs over the next decade as technology continues advancing, without risking serious economic damage or leaving behind lower-income drivers. An immediate ban ignores the complex realities of retooling an entire transportation sector and risks a severe public backlash. A gradual, market-based shift to EVs is a more prudent path that takes all stakeholders into consideration.",

Other professions have moved away from guaranteed lifetime employment, and higher education should follow suit. Replacing tenure with 5-10 year contracts that can be renewed based on performance reviews would bring accountability into a system that badly needs it. Exceptional professors with a proven track record of effective teaching and valuable research would have their contracts continually renewed, while underperforming professors would shape up or transition out.   \nUniversities are supposed to be bastions of progress, yet tenure is holding them back. It traps students with outdated teaching styles and unmotivated professors, despite ever-increasing tuition fees. Tenure reform is necessary to make professors more responsive to student needs, open up higher education to new ideas, and ensure that university resources are used efficiently. It's time to bring tenure into the 21st century through a system of renewable long-term contracts that reward excellence and phase out mediocrity.  Higher education deserves no less.",

However, as their role and influence have grown exponentially, so too have the misuses of their platforms to spread harmful, illegal, and dangerous content. \n\nWhile social media companies cannot be expected to preemptively screen every single post by billions of users, recent studies show an alarming trend: a small number of frequently shared posts, videos, or links are responsible for the majority of harmful or illegal content exposure on these platforms. By taking even modest steps to monitor repeat offenders and implement basic safeguards, companies could make an outsized impact in curbing the spread of problematic material. \n\nHolding platforms legally liable for repeat offenses would incentivize better detection and removal of harmful content before it reaches a wide audience. Some argue this infringes on free expression, but reasonable restrictions already limit speech that endangers others, such as threats, incitement, or distribution of illegal images/videos. Liability would encourage investment in monitored screening of only the highest-risk content from repeat violators - a small fraction receiving a disproportionate share of attention. This balanced solution protects free expression for all while reducing inadvertent harms.

        "argument": "Our personal information and privacy online have come under increasing threat in recent years. As technology rapidly advances and more of our lives move onto smartphones, computers, and the internet, the amount of data being collected about each individual has ballooned exponentially. However, protections for how this sensitive information can be used, shared, and secured have failed to keep pace. \n\nStudy after study has shown that technology companies and even some governments are sharing and selling our personal data, including location tracking, health details, browsing histories, passwords, and more, without our explicit consent or knowledge. As a result, over 90% of Americans report concerns about privacy and data security online, according to a 2020 Pew Research Poll. \n\nWhen hackers or unscrupulous actors are able to access our private data through leaks, breaches, or insufficient security protocols, the consequences can be devastating - ranging from identity theft and financial fraud to blackmail, stalking, and even targeting of activists or dissidents. One report estimated that data breaches cost the global economy over $5 trillion annually in damages.\n\nGiven these mounting privacy risks and economic costs, it is clear that governments and technology companies must take stronger action to better safeguard consumers. Stricter privacy laws, increased transparency into data usage, greater accountability for breaches, and stronger security by design can help restore public trust online and ensure that individual rights and safety are protected in the digital era. In order to have a free, fair and functioning digital ecosystem, protecting online privacy must become a higher priority.",
