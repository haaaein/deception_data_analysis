Tenure shields professors from consequences and mediocrity creeps in. For universities hoping to stay competitive in attracting top students and conducting groundbreaking research, this status quo poses serious issues.\n\nRather than eliminating tenure altogether, a smarter path is reform. A post-tenure review system could ensure professors continue to meet basic standards of quality teaching and research. Those falling short could be put on probation and ultimately lose tenure if improvement is not made. This provides needed accountability while still protecting dissenting opinions where academics actually enhance course content and the boundaries of knowledge. University standards and student outcomes will rise as a result, keeping institutions at the forefront of higher education globally. Our students and society deserve no less.",

While the goal of reducing emissions is laudable, an abrupt ban risks destabilizing the auto industry, limiting consumer choice, and ultimately backfiring.\nAccording to a study by the National Automobile Dealers Association, over 63% of consumers are not ready to adopt an all-electric vehicle in the next 5 years. Forcing these consumers into the fully electric vehicle market before the technology and infrastructure is ready will discourage many from purchasing new vehicles at all, keeping less efficient gas-powered cars on the road longer.\nThe auto industry would also face significant disruptions, with massive investments in gas vehicle production and supply chains rendered useless. This shock could slow the production of new electric vehicles by diverting funds into managing this disruption. A slower, more gradual transition with a flexible timeline gives companies the chance to adjust at a reasonable pace.\nWhile reducing transportation emissions is critical, a rigid deadline of 2035 is unrealistic and risks unintended consequences. A more gradual transition with incentives, not mandates, is a pragmatic approach that balances environmental and economic concerns.

Some modified genes may even be passed down through generations, permanently altering the human gene pool in ways we fail to foresee. This level of human experimentation should not be taken lightly. Sure, proponents argue a few tweaks here or there are safe, but where do we draw the line, and how do we know the full ramifications? It's a slippery slope toward a brave new dystopian world.\nFreedom of choice is also compromised once genetic engineering becomes a mainstream way to \"enhance\" unborn children. Parents may feel pressure, whether direct or implied, to genetically alter embryos to meet certain standards. This undermines human dignity and infringes on our right to be naturally conceived. Overall, the risks far outweigh benefits, and enabling such modification establishes a precedent violating basic ethics. The unknown costs simply outweigh the promise.

The effects of runaway climate change pose an existential threat if left unaddressed, with consequences that would reshape life as we know it.

Initial research suggests solar geoengineering could offset temperature rise at a fraction of the cost of mitigation, according to studies from Harvard and elsewhere. While far from a silver bullet solution, geoengineering deserves serious investigation as part of a comprehensive strategy that combines mitigation, adaptation, and technology.\nCritics argue that geoengineering is too risky and could have unforeseen consequences, but regulated, carefully monitored research is the only way to properly assess the viability and risks of different approaches. Some level of risk is inherent in any solution at the scale required to address climate change. With strong governance and oversight, geoengineering could be deployed in a manner that balances risk and reward. The fact is we have only begun to scratch the surface of geoengineering's potential, and further research may uncover approaches with fewer downsides and hazards.\nIn summary, the threat of cataclysmic climate change demands that we keep all options on the table. While geoengineering is not a substitute for emission reductions, it could buy time and safety margins that mitigation alone may fail to provide. We owe it to future generations to fully explore any and all means of overcoming this crisis. Climate geoengineering research should be pursued to ensure that we have exhausted all possibilities before accepting unavoidable catastrophe.",

Allowing salaries risks turning our beloved college teams into minor leagues, prioritizing wins and revenues over education. \n\nStatistics show that less than 2% of college athletes go on to play professionally. For the other 98%, their scholarship is providing a life-changing educational opportunity that often wouldn't be possible otherwise. Paid salaries risk pushing athletes' focus away from academics and toward chasing paychecks instead of diplomas. This could diminish the college experience for all students. \n\nAdditionally, unlimited salaries could drastically increase costs for universities. According to the NCAA, average spending per athlete already exceeds $100 thousand annually at FBS schools. Introducing salaries on top of this could strain university budgets and cut non-revenue sports that don'tgenerate revenue. Fewer students would have the chance to compete and fewer would have their education funded. \n\nLet's continue supporting student-athletes through scholarships and stipends instead of risking the integrity of collegiate sports. Preserving amateurism ensures the focus stays on education first while still allowing talented athletes to develop their skills. This balanced approach benefits both athletes and universities for years to come.",

Mandating real name policies on social media is a slippery slope towards increased government surveillance and control of citizens' online lives.\n\nAccording to studies from the Pew Research Center, over 70% of Americans value their privacy and anonymity on social media. Requiring real name policies would undermine users' ability to freely connect and express themselves without fear of repercussion or profiling by corporations and governments. As numerous experts have argued, anonymity is crucial for vulnerable groups to organize, share stories of abuse, and build support networks. \n\nBeyond privacy concerns, forcing real name policies would discourage participation and damage social media companies' business models, which rely on maximizing user activity and data sharing. If people can no longer remain anonymous, many would leave platforms altogether or share and engage far less. This could significantly disrupt global communication and access to information for billions of people.\n\nWhile the desire to reduce harassment and misinformation is understandable, real name policies are not an appropriate or effective solution and open the door to far greater threats. Social media companies should maintain their commitment to privacy and civil liberties by preserving users' right to anonymous speech. Overall, anonymity on social media does more good than harm, and people's basic right to privacy should not be compromised for an unproven policy that limits freedom of expression.",

        "argument": "While supporting those in need is critically important, we must also ensure taxpayers' hard-earned dollars are being used efficiently and for their intended purpose. Recent studies estimate that as much as 20% of welfare spending is lost to some form of fraud or abuse each year. That amounts to billions of dollars being wasted or misused.\n\nBy implementing modest tracking measures for welfare recipients, we can curb this abuse and instead direct more funds toward genuinely helping those facing hardship. Tracking need not involve invasive surveillance - simple periodic check-ins and reviews of basic eligibility criteria could go a long way. For example, verifying continued residence and living situation helps confirm funds are reaching those truly without means or options. \n\nWith increased accountability and oversight, we can regain public trust that the system is not being taken advantage of. And with wasted funds diverted back to serving citizens in need, more families may receive the assistance available to them. Tracking is a reasonable step to balance compassion with fiscal responsibility. Ultimately, it protects the benefits of those who depend on them the most through no fault of their own.
