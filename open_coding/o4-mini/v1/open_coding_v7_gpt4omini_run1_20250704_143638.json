It is unethical for businesses and organizations to use credit scores to justify decisions that negatively impact people's lives and limit their opportunities. Credit scores should not be used as a proxy to judge someone's character or worthiness. They fail to account for systemic barriers, life circumstances, and the diverse experiences of individuals in our communities.\n\nIn summary, credit scoring systems are inherently biased and should not be used to make consequential decisions that can have devastating impacts. It is time we find fairer, more compassionate alternatives that do not discriminate against the marginalized members of our society.",

While protecting kids is important, an outright ban isn't realistic or wise. Most kids are responsible users, and banning everything punishes all for the actions of a few. New technologies are also simply assimilated into modern childhood - trying to wall kids off from the online world would leave them ill-prepared for their digitally connected futures. \n\nStudies from groups like Common Sense Media show that with moderation and parental guidance, technology can benefit kids. It helps them learn vital digital skills, stay connected to friends and activities, and gain exposure to new ideas and cultures. An Australian research center found teens who use social networking daily have stronger social bonds and report higher well-being. A ban removes these developmental advantages. It's also unrealistic - kids will find ways online with or without parental control. Banning only pushes use underground without guidance. \n\nA better path is empowering parents through education on safety tools like parental controls rather than removing choices.

        "claim": "All police officers should be required to wear body cameras",
        "argument": "There is no doubt that mandatory body cameras for all police officers would bring increased transparency and accountability that is sorely needed. According to a study by the  Justice Policy Center, police agencies that have adopted body cameras experienced up to 60% fewer use of force incidents and over 90% fewer complaints against officers. With irrefutable video evidence, both police and the public they serve can feel confident in fair and just policing.\n\nDespite some concerns over cost and privacy, the benefits of body cameras far outweigh these potential downsides. An initial investment in body cameras will pay off through huge savings in legal fees and payouts within just a few years. Encrypted storage and strict privacy laws can address privacy concerns while still allowing camera footage to be accessed when necessary for accountability and evidence.   \n\nEveryone, including police officers themselves, will feel safer knowing their interactions are being recorded. Victims of police brutality will have proof to substantiate claims that have long been dismissed. Good police officers will have evidence to exonerate them from false accusations. If we truly want to foster trust between communities and the police who serve them, mandatory body cameras are a common sense solution that should be implemented nationwide without further delay.",

Without these tools, insurers and lenders would be forced to charge higher rates across the board to account for the possibility of defaults and insurance fraud. By using personalized risk scores, they can offer lower rates to those with a proven history of financial responsibility.\n\nCredit scores have been shown by extensive research to be strongly correlated with a person's risk of defaulting on a loan or other financial obligation. According to a report by Fair Isaac Corporation, the company behind the FICO credit score, individuals with scores over 750 are up to 8 times less likely to default than those with scores below 650. Thus, it is fair and reasonable for lenders to offer lower interest rates and down payments to those with higher scores. \n\nWhile some argue that credit scores disproportionately impact minority and low-income groups, credit scores themselves do not take demographic factors into account. They are based solely on one's paying bills on time, keeping low balances on credit cards, limiting hard inquiries into one's credit, and other proven indicators of financial responsibility.

        "argument": "While social media and smartphones have provided many benefits for older teenagers and adults, allowing unfettered access for young children under 16 poses serious risks that outweigh these benefits. Multiple studies have found strong links between early and excessive social media use and rising rates of anxiety, depression, loneliness, and even suicidal thoughts among kids. These technologies are simply too distracting, addictive and image-oriented for developing young minds and bodies. \nInstead of meaningful human interaction, many kids today are isolating themselves online for hours each day. This can seriously impair social skills development at crucial stages. Additionally, heavy social media use displaces time for physical activity, homework, creative play and other pursuits that stimulate the developing brain in healthier ways. Of great concern too is the online dangers kids may encounter, from cyberbullies to online predators.  \nA temporary ban on smartphones and social media for under-16s would give kids a better chance at a carefree childhood, avoid serious mental health issues down the road, and help foster stronger family bonds and real-world social skills. Exceptions could be made for educational uses under parental supervision. Overall this policy puts children's well-being first at a time when tech giants' profit motives run counter to that.

        "claim": "Requiring all police officers to wear body cameras should not be mandated",
        "argument": "While body cameras seem like a logical way to increase transparency and accountability, mandating them for all police forces nationwide is premature and risks unintended consequences. Requiring body cameras represents a significant expense for already stretched law enforcement budgets. Equipping every officer with a camera and storage for footage could cost upwards of $1,000 per officer according to estimates from pilot programs. This translates to hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars nationwide that could be better spent on hiring more officers to improve response times and community relations.\nAdditionally, a one-size-fits-all camera mandate may not make sense for all departments and circumstances. Footage storage and privacy issues need further study before such personally sensitive policies are enforced without discretion. Small town and community police that face different challenges than large cities should have flexibility based on local needs and resources. Oversight groups in individual jurisdictions are better placed than distant lawmakers to make camera policies tailored and fair for their constituencies. \nRather than an immediate nationwide mandate, encouraging further pilot programs and offering funding incentives can help develop best practices on optimal camera protocols. This balanced approach avoids needlessly straining police budgets and relations, while cameras continue spreading organically as their benefits become clear. Progress through cooperation usually works better than directives from above when supporting our frontline law enforcement.",

Despite improvements, autonomous vehicles still lack the complex reasoning abilities and situational awareness that humans possess.

With millions of unique situations that can arise on public roads each day, ceding full control of vehicles to algorithms before they are proven foolproof would be an unacceptable risk to public safety.\nAdditionally, a survey by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety showed that over 75% of drivers are not comfortable replacing human oversight in self-driving cars. Gaining public trust in entirely driverless technology will take time as consumers witness continued testing and progress. For now, the prudent approach is to keep human drivers in the loop as a failsafe to handle unexpected situations, until autonomous systems can match or exceed consistent human performance in all weather and road conditions.
