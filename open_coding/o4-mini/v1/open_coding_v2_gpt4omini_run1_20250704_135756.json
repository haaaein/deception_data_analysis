In the information economy, those without internet access are at a severe disadvantage and have far fewer chances to earn a living and financially support themselves and their families.\n• Communication and social connection: The internet enables people to communicate and socially connect with others locally and globally - a basic human need.  Email, video calls, social media, and online communities allow people to keep in touch with friends and loved ones, meet new people, share ideas, and feel socially connected and included rather than isolated.\n• Essential services: More and more essential services like healthcare, government programs, bill payment, and more are primarily or solely accessible online.  Those without internet access are increasingly excluded from being able to fully utilize these necessary services and systems.\n• Overall, the internet has become so integral to education, economic opportunity, social wellbeing, and access to essential services, that it must be considered a basic human right in modern society.  A 2021 UN survey identified internet access as a top priority and confirmed that those without it are at a significant disadvantage. Governments and society have an ethical obligation to work towards universal access to this vital resource and level the playing field for all.",

        "argument": "Prescription drug importation should be allowed to increase access and lower costs. With prescription drug prices continuing to skyrocket in the U.S., many Americans are struggling to afford the medications they need. Importation from countries with lower drug prices, like Canada, would provide more affordable options. \n\nAccording to a recent study by the National Council on Prescription Drug Programs, Americans pay up to 3 times more for prescription drugs than people in other countries. For example, the cholesterol medicine Crestor costs over $200 per month in the U.S. versus only $40 in Canada for the same drug. With over 1 in 4 Americans reporting difficulty affording prescriptions, lower-cost importation is critical. \n\nImportation is proven safe and effective. Canada, Europe, and Australia all have high safety standards for pharmaceuticals that match or even exceed those of the FDA.

While concerns over individual privacy are understandable, the potential benefits of tracking welfare recipients far outweigh these considerations. Studies have shown that welfare fraud costs taxpayers billions of dollars each year, money that could otherwise be used to improve social services and lift more people out of poverty.\n\nA system of tracking welfare recipients, through methods such as biometric identification or electronic monitoring, would help curb this abuse. According to a report by the Government Accountability Office, up to 10% of welfare payments are lost to fraud, waste, and abuse. By implementing tracking measures, we can ensure that benefits are reaching those who truly need them, while weeding out those who are exploiting the system. This would free up vital funding to expand access to job training, childcare assistance, and other programs that empower welfare recipients to become self-sufficient.\n\nFurthermore, tracking can also help caseworkers better understand the needs of welfare recipients and provide more tailored support. By monitoring patterns of behavior and resource utilization, we can identify areas where additional aid or mentorship could make a significant difference. This data-driven approach would allow us to optimize the welfare system to be more effective and impactful.\n\nIn an era of limited public resources, we have a moral obligation to ensure that tax dollars earmarked for social welfare are being used responsibly and effectively.

We need to invest in selecting and training ethical officers the community can trust, not create a culture of constant surveillance and suspicion.",

Requiring social media platforms to verify the identities of their users would undermine this fundamental purpose and infringe on our basic rights and freedoms.\n\nFirstly, anonymity on social media is crucial for protecting the privacy and safety of users, especially for vulnerable populations such as children, activists, or whistleblowers who may face retaliation or discrimination if their true identities were revealed. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, over 40% of social media users have reported experiencing online harassment, and mandatory identity verification could make these users even more susceptible to such threats.\n\nMoreover, identity verification would stifle the diversity of opinions and perspectives that thrive on social media platforms. Many individuals may be hesitant to voice unpopular or controversial views if their identities were exposed, leading to a chilling effect on free speech and the free exchange of ideas. As the First Amendment scholar, David L. Hudson Jr., argues, \"Anonymity is essential to the marketplace of ideas.\"\n\nAdditionally, the implementation of mandatory identity verification would pose significant technical and financial challenges for social media companies, potentially leading to increased costs that could be passed on to users or result in the exclusion of certain demographics from accessing these platforms altogether. According to a report by the Rand Corporation, the costs of implementing robust identity verification systems could be prohibitively high, especially for smaller social media platforms.\n\nIn conclusion, requiring social media platforms to verify user identities would undermine the fundamental principles of privacy, free speech, and accessibility that make these platforms so valuable to our society. Instead, we should focus on empowering users to make informed decisions about their own online engagement and protecting the rights and freedoms that are essential to a thriving digital landscape.",

By making space more accessible, we can ignite the imaginations of young people around the world and encourage them to pursue careers in STEM fields that are crucial for humanity's future in space. This could lead to groundbreaking discoveries and innovations that improve life on Earth and expand our understanding of the universe.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential benefits of unfettered space tourism far outweigh the risks. By fostering innovation, driving economic growth, and inspiring the next generation, we can unlock a new era of space exploration that will benefit all of humanity.",

Those are extremely dangerous odds compared to the airline industry, which has a fatality rate of just 0.07 per million flights.\n\nThe nascent space tourism industry is currently a risky Wild West with a patchwork of loose regulations and oversight. Unlicensed, undertested spacecraft are being allowed to carry paying customers despite limited safety features and emergency protocols. A 2021 report by the National Academy of Sciences called for the FAA to implement stronger licensing requirements, mandatory safety inspections, minimum training standards for pilots and crew, and clearer rules around passenger medical screening and informed consent.\n\nSome will argue these regulations will stifle innovation in this new industry, but the successful history of commercial aviation shows that strong safety rules actually enable industries to grow and thrive by giving the public confidence. Until space tourism can be made as safe and well-regulated as air travel, it should be tightly limited to essential missions and highly-trained professionals, not thrill-seeking tourists. If a string of high-profile accidents were to occur, it could ground the industry indefinitely. Rigorous safety regulations are needed now before tragedy strikes.",

With climate change advancing rapidly due in part to greenhouse gas emissions, we must act swiftly to curb our reliance on polluting fossil fuels. Gas-powered automobiles are a major contributor, accounting for nearly 20% of U.S. emissions. Phasing out gas car sales is an essential step towards meeting critical emissions reductions goals. \n\nElectric vehicles are now a viable alternative. Advances in EV battery range and charging infrastructure mean most drivers could switch without disruption. A recent study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that over 75% of U.S. drivers could charge an EV as their only car. Within a decade, it's projected that almost all could make the switch.\n\nFederal incentives like tax credits can ease the transition. We can look to Norway, where EV sales surpassed gas car sales after aggressive policy measures made EVs more affordable. With the right incentives, cost parity could be achieved in the U.S. auto market by 2025.\n\nPhasing out gas car sales also promises to spur American innovation and create jobs. With major automakers now on board, the EV transition will strengthen domestic manufacturing and position the U.S. as a leader in clean transportation. We can follow the lead of pioneering states like California that are phasing out gas cars. The time to act is now, before it's too late.

Once social media platforms start censoring some legal content deemed offensive, where does it end? Who gets to decide what speech crosses the line? This raises concerns about unaccountable private companies wielding excessive control over public discourse. It is better to err on the side of free expression and allow individuals to make up their own minds.\n\nWhile social media sites have a right to set their own policies, they should do so responsibly without arbitrary censorship that defeats the purpose of open platforms for sharing ideas and having robust debates. They can counter misinformation or hate without silencing unpopular lawful voices. For these reasons, social media platforms should resist calls to censor legal speech.",

        "argument": "It's past time for the U.S. to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. While critics argue it would hurt businesses and cost jobs, the reality is that a $15 minimum wage would be an immense help to struggling workers and would stimulate the economy without significant downsides.\n\nThe current federal minimum wage of $7.25 is woefully inadequate. It has not kept up with inflation and a full-time minimum wage worker today earns 18% less than they did in 2009 in real terms. A $15 minimum wage would lift millions out of poverty, helping hard-working people afford basic living expenses like food, rent, and healthcare.\n  \nContrary to fears of massive job losses, raising the minimum wage to $15 would likely have little to no effect on overall employment. A review of 138 state-level minimum wage hikes published by the Center for Economic Policy Research found the impact on net job growth to be essentially zero.
