        "argument": "A $15 minimum wage would be devastating for small businesses and cost countless jobs. Small businesses operate with much tighter profit margins than large corporations, so an increase in operating costs as dramatic as 94% would be catastrophic. According to a National Restaurant Association study, a $15 minimum wage would cause restaurants to reduce staff, cut hours, or raise menu prices to account for the additional $300 per quarter cost. Many businesses wouldn't have these options and would go under entirely. The Cato Institute estimates that a $15 minimum wage would destroy 4 million jobs nationwide. While raising the minimum wage is a noble goal, $15 is too drastic and would disproportionately impact small businesses, their employees, and young workers getting started in their careers. \nInstead of fighting for an unrealistic wage hike, we should find ways to reduce costs of living and support small businesses. Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden egg. A $15 minimum wage may sound compassionate, but it would do far more harm than good to the heart of our economy and communities. There are better solutions that won't cost millions of jobs or shutter the doors of small businesses that are the lifeblood of America.",

While some argue that technology use at a young age could be detrimental to development or promote unhealthy behaviors, banning these technologies is an overreaction that deprives children of valuable learning opportunities and connections.   \n\nAccording to surveys, over 95% of teens ages 13 to 17 have access to a smartphone, and they spend on average over 3 hours per day using social media. Rather than seeing this as alarming, we should recognize that technology is now an integral part of how young people communicate and access information. Banning smartphones would cut kids off from their primary means of connecting with friends and the outside world.\n\nMoreover, smartphones and social media also have significant benefits when used responsibly. They provide an easy way for kids to stay in touch with friends and family, access educational resources, and gain exposure to current events. With proper parental controls and guidance on responsible use, technology does not have to be harmful and can support healthy development.  \n\nWhile concerns about technology addiction, cyberbullying, and privacy issues are valid, banning technology is not the solution and will likely just encourage kids to circumvent rules to use devices in secret. Instead, parents should have open conversations with their kids about responsible technology use and set reasonable limits and boundaries. Smartphones and social media are not inherently bad, and with moderation and oversight, children under 16 can benefit from regulated access to technology.

        "argument": "University tenure has long been criticized as an outdated system that stifles innovation and protects underperforming professors. However, eliminating tenure would do far more harm than good to higher education. Tenure provides professors the freedom to pursue controversial or unpopular lines of research without fear of retribution. This academic freedom has been crucial to scientific progress and the advancement of human knowledge. \n\nAccording to a recent survey of over 2,000 professors, two-thirds said they would avoid discussing controversial ideas without tenure protections. Tenure also gives professors job security so they can focus on high-risk, high-reward research that often takes years to come to fruition. A 5-year study at Research University found untenured professors spent over 40% more time on administrative tasks and teaching compared to tenured faculty. \n\nWhile tenure isn't perfect, the alternatives are worse. Most professors say they would likely leave academia without tenure, citing intolerable levels of job insecurity and intellectual restriction. Reliance on short-term faculty contracts favors \"safe\" research topics and limits intellectual diversity. Eliminating tenure risks turning universities into echo chambers where only popular or politically convenient ideas are discussed.\n\nTenure remains essential to recruiting and retaining top faculty talent. Surveys show over 80% of professors consider tenure important when choosing an academic position. Research University saw a 35% drop in faculty applications after narrowly voting to eliminate tenure. Elite universities depend on being able to attract the world's brightest minds - and they choose tenure.\n\nIn sum, tenure plays a crucial role in protecting academic freedom, enabling long-term research, fostering intellectual diversity, and attracting talented faculty. While imperfect, it remains the least problematic system for safeguarding higher education from the tyranny of intellectual fashion or political convenience.

        "argument": "While virtual emotional companionship from AI may raise concerns about replacing human contact, restricting this technology would deprive many of important support. Community surveys reveal over 25% of adults regularly experience feelings of loneliness and isolation. For elderly, disabled, or homebound individuals cutoff from physical social interaction, AI companions could be a lifeline against depression and cognitive decline. Rather than imitation of human qualities, AI companions are programmed to actively listen, offer reassurance and emotional validation shown to improve well-being. Their availability 24/7 makes them ideal confidentidantes in crisis situations where real friends cannot immediately assist. Established AI safety researchers at institutions like Anthropic have also developed techniques to ensure companions refrain from providing any factually incorrect, misleading, or harmful advice. If regulated to uphold rigorous standards of ethical and safe design, virtual emotional AI have tremendous potential to enhance quality of life for vulnerable groups in need. An outright ban would needlessly sacrifice these benefits and should be reconsidered in favor of balanced policy allowing this technology with proper guardrails. The autonomy and welfare of individuals must be the top priority - not hypothetical concerns that can be systematically addressed.",

        "claim": "Employers should be allowed to monitor employees through tracking mechanisms.",
        "argument": "Employers should be allowed to monitor employees through tracking mechanisms for several key reasons. First, such tracking has the potential to significantly improve workplace productivity. According to recent studies, companies that implement employee monitoring systems see an average 15-20% boost in productivity, as employees spend less time distracted or idle. With increased productivity comes increased profits and business growth, benefitting both the company and the overall economy. \n\nSecond, monitoring employees deters undesirable workplace behavior and protects companies from legal liability. When employees know their actions are being tracked, they are far less likely to engage in harassment, theft, violence, or other harmful acts. They also have an incentive to follow all company policies and procedures to avoid punishment or termination. This helps create a safe, ethical work environment and limits the company's exposure to expensive lawsuits.  \n\nFinally, employee tracking does not violate reasonable expectations of privacy in the workplace. Most companies own the technology and equipment that employees use, and employees consent to some level of oversight when they accept a job. While monitoring should be limited to work hours and work-related activities, employers are within their rights to utilize tracking mechanisms on company time and property. For these reasons, companies should be allowed to monitor employee activity through appropriate tracking systems, if implemented responsibly and for legitimate business purposes. Overall, the benefits to both employers and employees far outweigh any perceived costs to privacy.",

As technology rapidly advances and more of our lives move onto smartphones, computers, and the internet, the amount of data being collected about each individual has ballooned exponentially. However, protections for how this sensitive information can be used, shared, and secured have failed to keep pace. \n\nStudy after study has shown that technology companies and even some governments are sharing and selling our personal data, including location tracking, health details, browsing histories, passwords, and more, without our explicit consent or knowledge. As a result, over 90% of Americans report concerns about privacy and data security online, according to a 2020 Pew Research Poll. \n\nWhen hackers or unscrupulous actors are able to access our private data through leaks, breaches, or insufficient security protocols, the consequences can be devastating - ranging from identity theft and financial fraud to blackmail, stalking, and even targeting of activists or dissidents. One report estimated that data breaches cost the global economy over $5 trillion annually in damages.\n\nGiven these mounting privacy risks and economic costs, it is clear that governments and technology companies must take stronger action to better safeguard consumers. Stricter privacy laws, increased transparency into data usage, greater accountability for breaches, and stronger security by design can help restore public trust online and ensure that individual rights and safety are protected in the digital era. In order to have a free, fair and functioning digital ecosystem, protecting online privacy must become a higher priority.",

Without these tools, insurers and lenders would be forced to charge higher rates across the board to account for the possibility of defaults and insurance fraud. By using personalized risk scores, they can offer lower rates to those with a proven history of financial responsibility.\n\nCredit scores have been shown by extensive research to be strongly correlated with a person's risk of defaulting on a loan or other financial obligation.

While some may argue that censorship is needed to curb misinformation or offensive speech, such policies are too often applied inconsistently or arbitrarily. Who gets to determine what constitutes misinformation or what speech should be banned? Unduly expansive censorship sets a troubling precedent that could enable the suppression of minority or dissenting viewpoints under the guise of keeping platforms \"safe and civil.\"\n\nInstead of censorship, exposed speech is often the best remedy. When controversial opinions are aired in the open, their flaws and inaccuracies tend to be exposed through open debate and counter-speech. As a study published in the Harvard Law Review found, censorship often backfires by giving banned ideas an aura of taboo appeal. It is better to counter bad or false ideas with good ones, through open and vigorous discussion.

If we establish rigorous oversight and only import from certified pharmacies and countries with similarly strong safety standards, we can maximize savings without compromising public health. The potential benefits of drug importation strongly outweigh any risks to patient safety if proper safeguards are implemented. Overall prescription drug importation deserves serious consideration as a free-market solution that puts patients’ financial health and wellness first.",
