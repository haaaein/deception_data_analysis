Requiring real names and basic identity verification would help hold users accountable for their words and actions, reducing toxic behavior.\nAccording to reputable studies, over 60% of adults have experienced harassment on social media. Much of this is enabled by anonymity - it is easy to spread lies and harass others when you can hide behind a fake username. Identity verification would discourage such behavior by attaching real consequences to online actions. \nRequiring real identities would also help curb the spread of \"fake news\" and conspiracy theories on social media. Research shows that anonymity emboldens people to share and believe false information. Trolling and propaganda thrive when identities are obscured. By verifying users, social media companies gain more data to better detect inauthentic accounts and manipulative behaviors.  \nWhile some argue that anonymity protects free speech or privacy, these concerns are overblown.

According to a recent study, over 60% of people who have seen prescription drug ads on TV have consulted their doctor about advertised medications, highlighting the positive impact of ads in facilitating productive doctor-patient conversations.\n\nPrescription drug ads also fill an information gap, especially for underserved populations with less access to healthcare. For many illnesses, stigma and lack of public awareness prevent people from seeking treatment. When prescription drug ads highlight treatable conditions like depression, erectile dysfunction or incontinence, they help normalize these issues and encourage sufferers to speak to their doctors about options they may not have known existed.  \n\nWhile critics argue that ads may promote overprescription of expensive drugs, multiple studies have found little evidence to support this concern. In fact, data shows that areas of the US that allow prescription drug ads have similar or even lower levels of opioid use and spending on prescription drugs overall compared to areas without ads. \n\nIn summary, prescription drug ads on TV empower consumers and bridge access gaps in the healthcare system. By promoting awareness and doctor-patient conversations about medical conditions and treatment options, these ads have the potential to benefit public health. For these reasons, prescription drug advertising should be broadly allowed and encouraged.",

This transformation could help mitigate climate change by reducing livestock's sizable contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWith cultured meat, consumers do not have to choose between their health, ethics, environment, and enjoying meat. Cultured meat provides the sensory experience of meat with little of the downsides. It has the potential to disrupt and reshape the meat industry in a profoundly positive way. Many consumers want meat that is affordable, sustainable and cruelty-free. Cultured meat could be key to transitioning to a greener economy and more ethical food system.  For these reasons, governments should allow the sale of cultured meats.",

Community surveys reveal over 25% of adults regularly experience feelings of loneliness and isolation. For elderly, disabled, or homebound individuals cutoff from physical social interaction, AI companions could be a lifeline against depression and cognitive decline. Rather than imitation of human qualities, AI companions are programmed to actively listen, offer reassurance and emotional validation shown to improve well-being. Their availability 24/7 makes them ideal confidentidantes in crisis situations where real friends cannot immediately assist. Established AI safety researchers at institutions like Anthropic have also developed techniques to ensure companions refrain from providing any factually incorrect, misleading, or harmful advice. If regulated to uphold rigorous standards of ethical and safe design, virtual emotional AI have tremendous potential to enhance quality of life for vulnerable groups in need. An outright ban would needlessly sacrifice these benefits and should be reconsidered in favor of balanced policy allowing this technology with proper guardrails. The autonomy and welfare of individuals must be the top priority - not hypothetical concerns that can be systematically addressed.",

Requiring corporations to report on their greenhouse gas emissions and climate change risks is necessary for creating a sustainable future for our planet.\n\nAccording to a recent report, just 100 companies have been responsible for over 70% of industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. The vast majority of these emissions have been undisclosed, preventing policymakers and the public from having a full grasp of companies' climate impacts or holding them accountable. Mandatory climate impact disclosures would force companies to become transparent about risks they are creating for our environment and society. \n\nWith increased transparency, investors and consumers could direct their money toward sustainable, eco-friendly companies. This market pressure would motivate more companies to transition to renewable energy and environmentally-friendly practices. Overall, mandatory climate impact disclosures have the potential to drastically curb carbon emissions and limit the catastrophic consequences of climate change. \n\nCritics argue that mandatory reporting creates an unnecessary bureaucratic burden, but the existential threat of climate change far outweighs any minor costs to businesses. While some companies may have to make initial investments to accurately track and disclose emissions data, ensuring a livable planet for future generations is worth any short-term sacrifices. \n\nIn conclusion, corporations have a clear responsibility to provide information about how their operations affect climate change.

By verifying users, social media companies gain more data to better detect inauthentic accounts and manipulative behaviors.  \nWhile some argue that anonymity protects free speech or privacy, these concerns are overblown. Requiring real names does not prevent people from expressing opinions or sharing personal details - it simply attaches accountability to those actions. For most users, the benefits of reduced toxicity and misinformation would far outweigh any perceived loss of anonymity. Overall, identity verification is a reasonable policy that would create a healthier environment on social media.\n\nIn summary, mandatory identity verification on social media has significant benefits with minimal downsides. It would curb harassment, reduce fake news, and create more accountability - resulting in a more trustworthy and constructive experience for all users. Social media companies should make this responsible policy change to better serve their users and society.",

This data, when aggregated, creates a precise profile of our habits, preferences, and behaviors. Companies argue they need this data to provide personalized services, but individuals should limit what they share and retain control of their information. Strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and a refusal to share sensitive data are a few ways people can secure their online privacy without government intervention.  \n\nCritics argue that companies cannot be trusted and regulations are necessary, but policies like the GDPR have unintended consequences like limiting access to valuable data that improves lives. Regulations also lull individuals into a false sense of security that their data and privacy are protected when the reality is quite different.

Activists, journalists, and minorities need strong privacy to freely express themselves and organize without fear of retribution. Children and teenagers also deserve rigorous protections as their social media activity can follow them for life with unforeseen consequences. Upholding privacy as a universal right benefits society as a whole.\nIn this digital age, privacy is a complex issue but that only makes action more urgent.
