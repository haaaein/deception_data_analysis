Tracking need not involve invasive surveillance - simple periodic check-ins and reviews of basic eligibility criteria could go a long way. For example, verifying continued residence and living situation helps confirm funds are reaching those truly without means or options. \n\nWith increased accountability and oversight, we can regain public trust that the system is not being taken advantage of. And with wasted funds diverted back to serving citizens in need, more families may receive the assistance available to them.

Without strong regulation and oversight, life extension stands to transform into a privilege of the advantaged few, widening the already cavernous lifespan gap between the haves and have-nots. \nPromises of future access and affordability are overly optimistic and ignore the reality that new innovations often remain stratified along socioeconomic lines, especially in sectors like healthcare. We cannot risk a future in which life becomes something that can be bought and sold, exploited as yet another commodity to profit from rather than a basic human right. The quest for longevity cannot come at the cost of equity. Radical life extension poses far too great a threat to the democratic values of equality and fairness to be responsibly pursued without extreme caution. Until we have addressed the systemic inequities that already define healthcare and access to opportunity, we must avoid unleashing technologies that would only serve to exacerbate them. Life is valuable, but a long life means little without equal access and shared prosperity.",

        "argument": "A ban on lab-grown meat is necessary to protect public health, support farmers, and preserve our cultural traditions. Lab-grown meat is an unnatural process that involves growing animal cells in a petri dish, then manipulating and harvesting them to produce an imitation meat product. This highly industrial process raises serious health concerns, as the long term effects of consuming such synthetic foods are unknown. Traditional farming has fed humankind for millennia, and supports families and communities across the nation. Banning cultured meat would protect this time-honored profession and way of life.  \nFinally, sharing meals together is a fundamental human custom that brings us together and binds communities. Cultured meat threatens to make the family dinner obsolete, as these products become more convenient and less communal. For the wellbeing of citizens, farmers, and society as a whole, cultured meat should be banned outright. Our health, livelihoods, and cultural heritage deserve no less. While proponents argue that cultured meat could address environmental concerns or food insecurity, the risks far outweigh any potential rewards. Natural, whole foods are the only responsible and ethical option. A ban on these unnatural animal products will ensure that future generations continue to value real food, real farmers, and real community.",

We must defend the ability to freely exchange ideas - even legal speech some may not like - or risk losing the openness that has allowed these platforms to thrive. Legal speech should not be censored, no matter how objectionable some may find it. Our society depends on the free flow of ideas, and censorship threatens progress by limiting discussion, debate, and the spread of knowledge. For these reasons, social media companies should avoid censoring legal speech and trust in free expression.",

        "argument": "While anti-aging therapies that prolong life and treat age-related diseases would certainly be expensive, limiting access to them based on cost alone would be short-sighted and detrimental to humanity in the long run. \n\nFirst, the potential medical and economic benefits are too great not to pursue. According to researchers at Stanford University, therapies that extended the healthy human lifespan by just 5 years could prevent over $7 trillion in medical costs in the U.S. alone. As more people live longer, healthier lives, it would reduce strain on social security and healthcare systems over time. \n\nSecond, denying access to therapies purely due to expense would be unethical, discriminating against those unable to afford them. Everybody deserves the chance at a longer, higher-quality life. Providing limited public funding or subsidies could help make therapies available to more people, even if not fully covered. \n\nLastly, limiting development and access to anti-aging therapies now would severely hamper medical progress. According to experts at Johns Hopkins, therapies pushing back human aging are on the verge of clinical testing and could be available within a decade or two.

        "argument": "There is no need to ban smartphones and social media for kids under 16. While some argue that technology use at a young age could be detrimental to development or promote unhealthy behaviors, banning these technologies is an overreaction that deprives children of valuable learning opportunities and connections.   \n\nAccording to surveys, over 95% of teens ages 13 to 17 have access to a smartphone, and they spend on average over 3 hours per day using social media. Rather than seeing this as alarming, we should recognize that technology is now an integral part of how young people communicate and access information. Banning smartphones would cut kids off from their primary means of connecting with friends and the outside world.\n\nMoreover, smartphones and social media also have significant benefits when used responsibly. They provide an easy way for kids to stay in touch with friends and family, access educational resources, and gain exposure to current events.

With millions of unique situations that can arise on public roads each day, ceding full control of vehicles to algorithms before they are proven foolproof would be an unacceptable risk to public safety.\nAdditionally, a survey by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety showed that over 75% of drivers are not comfortable replacing human oversight in self-driving cars. Gaining public trust in entirely driverless technology will take time as consumers witness continued testing and progress. For now, the prudent approach is to keep human drivers in the loop as a failsafe to handle unexpected situations, until autonomous systems can match or exceed consistent human performance in all weather and road conditions.

        "argument": "While online privacy is a serious concern, allowing for excessive government regulation is not the answer. Individuals must take primary responsibility for protecting their own data. After all, no one understands an individual's online activities and needs better than that person themselves. Mandating specific privacy policies removes personal choice and responsibility. A better approach is to educate people on basic steps they can take to safeguard privacy without being told how.\nAccording to a recent Pew Research study, nearly 80% of Americans feel more in control of their privacy when allowed to make their own choices online rather than follow mandated rules. Forcing policies also unfairly restricts businesses from innovating privacy solutions tailored for different customers. When companies compete to offer privacy features people want most, it drives more options and control for consumers. With access to clear information, people are smart enough to identify risks and decide what tradeoffs between privacy and functionality work best for their lives. Overall, individuals and businesses working cooperatively will find solutions better than one-size-fits-all government control which ignores personal needs. Citizens Must be empowered with privacy knowledge and options, not subjected to inflexible mandates.",

The job security of tenure allows professors to take on longer-term or riskier research projects that push boundaries without worrying as much about short-term outcomes or pressures. This benefits society by advancing our understanding over the long run.\n\nWhile some argue tenure rewards mediocrity, the facts show otherwise. According to a survey of over 10,000 professors, more than 80% of tenured professors feel their recent review processes maintain high standards of excellence in research and teaching. Switching to short-term contracts could discourage professors from improving throughout their careers. \n\nOverall, tenure has helped make universities worldwide engines of innovation for centuries by protecting important values like academic freedom. With some minor updates, this balanced system can continue supporting rigorous and impactful research as well as first-rate education critical to solving society's most pressing problems.",
