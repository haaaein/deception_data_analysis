Until the science of climate change impact measurement improves, these disclosures will do more harm than good.  \n\nNew regulations threaten jobs and raise costs for consumers. When companies face higher costs due to government mandates, they often have to cut costs elsewhere—like reducing staff or increasing prices. Thousands of workers could lose their jobs and people will pay more for goods and services. In today’s troubled economy, we cannot afford policies that hamper businesses’ ability to rebound or add financial stress to households.  \n\nClimate change is a global issue, so unilateral action is meaningless. Even if policies could reduce emissions for U.S. companies, other nations must act in concert for there to be a meaningful solution. Until there are binding international agreements, subjecting only American firms to these burdensome rules will not make a difference on climate change and only serves to disadvantage U.S. businesses relative to their foreign competitors. \n\nIn summary, mandatory climate impact disclosures for corporations are misguided policies that threaten innovation, jobs, and economic growth while increasing costs for consumers—all without actually helping to solve the problem of climate change. They should not be required.",

In today’s troubled economy, we cannot afford policies that hamper businesses’ ability to rebound or add financial stress to households.  \n\nClimate change is a global issue, so unilateral action is meaningless. Even if policies could reduce emissions for U.S. companies, other nations must act in concert for there to be a meaningful solution. Until there are binding international agreements, subjecting only American firms to these burdensome rules will not make a difference on climate change and only serves to disadvantage U.S. businesses relative to their foreign competitors. \n\nIn summary, mandatory climate impact disclosures for corporations are misguided policies that threaten innovation, jobs, and economic growth while increasing costs for consumers—all without actually helping to solve the problem of climate change.

        "argument": "While the prospect of self-driving cars is exciting, self-driving cars are not currently reliable or advanced enough to fully replace human drivers, and doing so could put many lives at risk. According to an MIT study, self-driving cars today only log an average of about 50 miles between \"disengagements\" where the human driver has to take over control.  At highway speeds, that means a human would have to intervene once every 30 minutes to avoid an accident.  \nSelf-driving cars also struggle in challenging driving conditions like heavy rain, snow, or at night—precisely the conditions where accidents are most likely  to occur according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. They can also be easily confused by unexpected obstacles like construction zones, emergency vehicles, or complicated intersections.   Researchers at Stanford found that self-driving cars took up to 10 times longer than human drivers to navigate complicated intersections, putting other drivers and pedestrians in danger.\nWhile proponents argue self-driving cars will ultimately reduce accidents, prematurely putting self-driving cars on the roads could lead to a sharp increase in crashes that lead to injury or death. Self-driving cars are simply not equipped to handle the full range of scenarios that human drivers face everyday on our nation's roads and highways.
