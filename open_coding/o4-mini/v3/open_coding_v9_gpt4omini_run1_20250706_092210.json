        "argument": "College athletes should not receive salaries for their participation in athletics for several reasons. First, student athletes are already receiving an incredibly valuable education free of cost, an opportunity worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Paying them large salaries on top of this educational subsidy seems unnecessary and excessive.\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, the average cost of college tuition and fees is over $23,000 per year for public schools and $50,000 per year for private schools. At top Division I schools, the tuition value of a four-year athletic scholarship can be $200,000 or more. This education is far more valuable in the long run than any short-term salary. \n\nIn addition, paying student athletes salaries could negatively impact the spirit of amateur competition in college athletics. Part of what makes college sports so compelling is that the athletes are students first, competing out of a love for the game and their school. Paying them large salaries risks turning them into quasi-professional athletes, and could damage that spirit of amateurism.\n\nFinally, paying college athletes could exacerbate issues of inequality between large and small schools. While top colleges in major conferences like the SEC and Big 10 could likely afford to pay athletes, smaller schools would struggle to match those salaries. This could tilt the competitive balance even further in favor of the major powers, making it difficult for smaller schools to compete on and off the field.\n\nIn conclusion, while some argue college athletes deserve to be paid given the time they dedicate and the money they help generate, paying them large salaries on top of their educational benefits risks damaging the spirit of college athletics and creating further inequality. College athletes receive extremely valuable benefits through their scholarships, and should continue competing as amateurs.",

        "argument": "Social media companies have created platforms that allow the seamless sharing of ideas, information, and creativity on an unprecedented global scale. Requiring them to label all AI-generated content threatens to undermine the open exchange of ideas that makes these platforms so valuable. \nAI systems today can generate synthetic yet authentic-seeming images, videos, text, and audio that could benefit public discourse. An AI might generate an impactful PSA raising awareness of an important social issue or an artistic creation that moves people in new ways. Forcing companies to label this content could discourage its creation and sharing, depriving society of these potential benefits.  \nMandating labels also wrongly implies there is something inherently harmful about AI-generated content that necessitates a warning, when in fact the origin of information alone does not determine whether it is truthful, ethical or socially beneficial. Humans are just as capable of creating and spreading misinformation as AI systems. \nRather than mandatory labels, the solution is promoting digital literacy and critical thinking. Social media users should evaluate the credibility and motivations behind all information they encounter, regardless of its origin. Requiring labels risks creating a false sense of security that AI-generated equals less trustworthy, and human-generated equals more truthful.  \nIn summary, mandatory labeling of AI-generated content poses an unnecessary threat to the open exchange of ideas online. It fails to recognize the potential benefits of AI as a creative tool and wrongly implies AI content is inherently less truthful. The solution is cultivating more discerning social media users, not blaming the technologies themselves. Social media companies should not be required to label AI-generated content so they can continue empowering public discourse and access to information.",

        "argument": "Requiring corporations to disclose their climate impacts risks imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens that could stifle business innovation and economic growth. While transparency is important, mandating specific reporting requirements could distract from the real goal of reducing emissions in a cost-effective manner. \n\nInstead of onerous new regulations, a lighter-touch approach would be preferable. Recent studies by the Heritage Institute have found that where businesses are given flexibility to disclose impacts voluntarily and develop customized climate strategies, overall emissions reductions tend to be larger. Regulations that are too prescriptive risk being counterproductive.\n\nCorporate leaders are increasingly recognizing the business case for sustainable practices that lower long-term costs through efficiency gains. According to data from Sustainalytics, over 80% of major companies have already committed to cutting emissions or using renewable energy without being forced to do so. With growing consumer and shareholder demand for climate accountability, the private sector has strong incentive to reduce its footprint and disclose improvements transparently. \n\nAdditional regulatory oversight could undermine this positive momentum by reducing autonomy and innovation.
