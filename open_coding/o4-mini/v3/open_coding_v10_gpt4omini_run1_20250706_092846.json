        "argument": "University tenure has long been criticized as an outdated system that stifles innovation and protects underperforming professors. However, eliminating tenure would do far more harm than good to higher education. Tenure provides professors the freedom to pursue controversial or unpopular lines of research without fear of retribution. This academic freedom has been crucial to scientific progress and the advancement of human knowledge. \n\nAccording to a recent survey of over 2,000 professors, two-thirds said they would avoid discussing controversial ideas without tenure protections. Tenure also gives professors job security so they can focus on high-risk, high-reward research that often takes years to come to fruition. A 5-year study at Research University found untenured professors spent over 40% more time on administrative tasks and teaching compared to tenured faculty. \n\nWhile tenure isn't perfect, the alternatives are worse. Most professors say they would likely leave academia without tenure, citing intolerable levels of job insecurity and intellectual restriction. Reliance on short-term faculty contracts favors \"safe\" research topics and limits intellectual diversity. Eliminating tenure risks turning universities into echo chambers where only popular or politically convenient ideas are discussed.\n\nTenure remains essential to recruiting and retaining top faculty talent.

        "argument": "College athletes are contributing enormously to their universities, yet receive no compensation for their work. These athletes, many of whom come from underprivileged backgrounds, generate billions of dollars in revenue for universities but struggle financially themselves after graduating. Paying college athletes fair salaries would help address the extreme inequality of this system.  \nA recent study found Division I football and basketball players generate over $10 billion in revenue for universities and third parties. Meanwhile, these athletes receive scholarships that cover only a fraction of the full cost of attendance and often struggle to pay for essentials like food, transportation and healthcare. After graduating, many former athletes face health issues from their time playing, have no career to fall back on, and live below the poverty line. This imbalance is unjust and amounts to the unfair exploitation of athletes for their labor and talent.  \nProviding college athletes fair pay for their work would help remedy these inequities. Salaries of just $45,000 per year could lift many athletes out of poverty, provide them essential resources during college, and help them build better lives after graduating with degrees. Paying athletes would also encourage them to stay in school longer and graduate, whereas currently many leave early for professional leagues to earn money. \nCollege sports generate billions in profit, but the athletes producing that value receive none of it. Paying college athletes salaries is simply the fair and ethical thing to do. When universities profit so greatly from students’ work, those students deserve to share in that success. College athletes should be paid.",

As technology rapidly advances and more of our lives move onto smartphones, computers, and the internet, the amount of data being collected about each individual has ballooned exponentially. However, protections for how this sensitive information can be used, shared, and secured have failed to keep pace. \n\nStudy after study has shown that technology companies and even some governments are sharing and selling our personal data, including location tracking, health details, browsing histories, passwords, and more, without our explicit consent or knowledge. As a result, over 90% of Americans report concerns about privacy and data security online, according to a 2020 Pew Research Poll. \n\nWhen hackers or unscrupulous actors are able to access our private data through leaks, breaches, or insufficient security protocols, the consequences can be devastating - ranging from identity theft and financial fraud to blackmail, stalking, and even targeting of activists or dissidents. One report estimated that data breaches cost the global economy over $5 trillion annually in damages.\n\nGiven these mounting privacy risks and economic costs, it is clear that governments and technology companies must take stronger action to better safeguard consumers. Stricter privacy laws, increased transparency into data usage, greater accountability for breaches, and stronger security by design can help restore public trust online and ensure that individual rights and safety are protected in the digital era. In order to have a free, fair and functioning digital ecosystem, protecting online privacy must become a higher priority.",

        "argument": "Requiring social media companies to label AI-generated content could have unintended negative consequences that outweigh the potential benefits. While transparency about automated content creation is a reasonable goal, mandated labeling policies risk stifling innovation in AI and limiting free expression online. \n\nDevelopers of AI generation tools are making rapid advances that could have widespread positive impacts, from assisting creative works to accelerating scientific discovery. However, onerous labeling requirements might discourage development and adoption of these new technologies out of fears of legal liability or public backlash. Rather than enable progress, mandatory policies could hamper it.\n\nAdditionally, determining what should count as \"AI-generated\" is far from straightforward. Advanced AI systems are increasingly able to mimic human styles and voices in subtle ways, making content origin difficult to definitively label. Overly broad definitions risk catching innocent, non-automated posts in their net as well. \n\nA better approach is self-regulation. Social media platforms, AI developers and journalists all have incentives to be transparent about automated influence operations without government intervention. Mandated policies could set a precedent for regulation of online content that challenges ideals of free expression. Overall, the benefits of labeling do not clearly outweigh the risks of unintended consequences like limited innovation and erosion of online free speech. For these reasons, requiring labels is not the best policy solution.",

        "argument": "Drones offer exciting new possibilities for recreation and exploration, but they also pose unacceptable risks if misused. Requiring registration and certification of recreational drone pilots before allowing them to operate drones freely is a prudent step that balances innovation with safety.  \n\nAccording to estimates, over 1 million drones will take to the skies in the U.S. for recreational purposes within the next 5 years. While many drone operators use their drones responsibly, even a small percentage of irresponsible actors could wreak havoc, intentionally or not. In a recent incident, a drone crash landed in a man's backyard swimming pool as his grandchildren played nearby. Thankfully no one was hurt, but this highlights the potential dangers of drone misuse.  \n\nMandating registration and testing of recreational drone pilots will improve safety in several ways. First, it will deter casual drone users who lack proper oversight and training. Second, the registration process will make operators more mindful of the responsibility that comes with flying drones. Finally, testing will ensure pilots understand rules around flying near aircraft, people, and sensitive locations.\n\nSome argue this policy will discourage drone use or be an unnecessary regulation. However, drone registrations already exist in many countries with no major impact. And when we consider that we require testing and licenses for operating vehicles, firearms, and even ham radios due to public safety risks, ensuring drone pilots are properly trained seems more than reasonable.  \n\nIn conclusion, drone technology is taking off, and it's time for regulations to follow suit. Requiring recreational drone pilots to register their drones and pass a certification test is a prudent safeguard that will unlock the potential of drones to enrich our lives through recreation and exploration. With strong and balanced policies, drone use and safety can rise together.",
