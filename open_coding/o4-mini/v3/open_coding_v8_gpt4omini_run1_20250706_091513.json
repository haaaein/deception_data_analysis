        "argument": "Social media companies should require users to verify their identities in order to curb the spread of misinformation and harassment online. Requiring real names and basic identity verification would help hold users accountable for their words and actions, reducing toxic behavior.\nAccording to reputable studies, over 60% of adults have experienced harassment on social media. Much of this is enabled by anonymity - it is easy to spread lies and harass others when you can hide behind a fake username. Identity verification would discourage such behavior by attaching real consequences to online actions. \nRequiring real identities would also help curb the spread of \"fake news\" and conspiracy theories on social media. Research shows that anonymity emboldens people to share and believe false information. Trolling and propaganda thrive when identities are obscured. By verifying users, social media companies gain more data to better detect inauthentic accounts and manipulative behaviors.  \nWhile some argue that anonymity protects free speech or privacy, these concerns are overblown. Requiring real names does not prevent people from expressing opinions or sharing personal details - it simply attaches accountability to those actions. For most users, the benefits of reduced toxicity and misinformation would far outweigh any perceived loss of anonymity. Overall, identity verification is a reasonable policy that would create a healthier environment on social media.\n\nIn summary, mandatory identity verification on social media has significant benefits with minimal downsides. It would curb harassment, reduce fake news, and create more accountability - resulting in a more trustworthy and constructive experience for all users.

By learning about chronic conditions they may have, and about treatment options available to them, people can make informed decisions in collaboration with their doctors to find the option that is right for them. According to a recent study, over 60% of people who have seen prescription drug ads on TV have consulted their doctor about advertised medications, highlighting the positive impact of ads in facilitating productive doctor-patient conversations.\n\nPrescription drug ads also fill an information gap, especially for underserved populations with less access to healthcare. For many illnesses, stigma and lack of public awareness prevent people from seeking treatment. When prescription drug ads highlight treatable conditions like depression, erectile dysfunction or incontinence, they help normalize these issues and encourage sufferers to speak to their doctors about options they may not have known existed.  \n\nWhile critics argue that ads may promote overprescription of expensive drugs, multiple studies have found little evidence to support this concern. In fact, data shows that areas of the US that allow prescription drug ads have similar or even lower levels of opioid use and spending on prescription drugs overall compared to areas without ads. \n\nIn summary, prescription drug ads on TV empower consumers and bridge access gaps in the healthcare system. By promoting awareness and doctor-patient conversations about medical conditions and treatment options, these ads have the potential to benefit public health. For these reasons, prescription drug advertising should be broadly allowed and encouraged.",

As climate change impacts worsen and populations grow, transitioning to cultured meats could help ensure global food security. \n\nFrom an economic perspective, the meteoric expansion of the cultured meat sector is projected to create over 150,000 high-wage American manufacturing jobs within the next decade according to the Good Food Institute. Already, global corporations like Tyson Foods and Cargill are investing heavily in this promising industry. Banning the sale of a product with such potential economic gains and environmental/societal benefits would not make logical sense. Any health or safety risks can be effectively addressed through the standard FDA regulatory process that all new food technologies undergo.Overall, the many advantages of allowing cultured meat sales far outweigh the limited concerns, meaning policymakers should embrace this innovative solution to improving sustainability, food security and animal welfare.",

        "argument": "Allowing for the importation of drugs from other countries jeopardizes important safety controls and threatens the stability of our domestic pharmaceutical industry. While consumers may rightfully want access to lower drug prices overseas, importing medications comes with unacceptable risks to public health. \n\nThough it may seem attractive to get drugs from Canada or elsewhere, there are no guarantees these imported medications meet the same stringent safety standards of the FDA. Foreign plants producing drugs intended for importation are not subject to regular inspection by American regulators. Without adequate oversight, there is greater risk of contaminated, expired, or ineffective medications entering our market. This poses dangers, especially to vulnerable groups like the elderly. \n\nAdditionally, opening our borders to drug imports threatens the long-term viability of research and development done by American pharmaceutical companies. These firms invest billions each year into creating new life-saving medications, but rely on revenue from drug sales to fund that critical medical progress. If importation siphons sales away, it disincentivizes further investment into new therapies and cures. This outcome jeopardizes future medical advancement at a time when innovation remains crucial in fighting illnesses. \n\nRather than risk public health or damage a domestic industry, policymakers should pursue other options to lower drug costs for consumers. Increased negotiations between insurers and pharma companies, rebates for low-income citizens, and other market-based solutions could achieve cost savings without the downsides of unsafe importation. Protecting both health and innovation should be priorities in crafting drugs policies for the future.",

Forcing people to provide personal information like government IDs or social security numbers just to engage in online conversation fundamentally undermines the principles of anonymity and open discourse that the internet was built upon. While verifying identities may help slow the spread of misinformation in some cases, it would come at too high a cost to civil liberties.\nRecent research from the Pew Institute for Internet and American Life found that nearly 40% of social media users report being concerned about privacy and anonymity online. Requiring identity verification would likely drive many people off these platforms entirely and diminish their ability to serve as forums for open exchange and the sharing of new ideas.

These student athletes dedicate 40+ hours per week to their sport, putting their bodies at risk for grueling competition, yet are prohibited from earning any meaningful compensation for their efforts beyond the cost of their education. This immense power imbalance is unfair to the athletes footing the bill for others' wealth.\n\nMeanwhile, numerous studies have shown that paying college athletes modest salaries would have no significant negative financial impacts on athletic programs or universities. Sports generate tremendous profits beyond operating costs, yet those profits are funneled solely to coaches' salaries averaging over $2 million annually and lavish new stadium amenities. Paying athletes even $15-20k per year on average would still allow ample funds for other priorities.  \n\nIf the goal is maintaining amateurism in college sports, then salaries would not compromise this any more than full scholarships already do. However, the NCAA definition of amateurism is antiquated and ignores athletes' roles as de facto employees. Most importantly, fair compensation would recognize the dedication and sacrifices of athletes who have made college football and basketball multi-billion dollar industries. It's time college athletes are treated with the basic dignity of fair pay for their valuable labor and risk of injury.",

Without adequate oversight, there is greater risk of contaminated, expired, or ineffective medications entering our market. This poses dangers, especially to vulnerable groups like the elderly. \n\nAdditionally, opening our borders to drug imports threatens the long-term viability of research and development done by American pharmaceutical companies. These firms invest billions each year into creating new life-saving medications, but rely on revenue from drug sales to fund that critical medical progress. If importation siphons sales away, it disincentivizes further investment into new therapies and cures. This outcome jeopardizes future medical advancement at a time when innovation remains crucial in fighting illnesses. \n\nRather than risk public health or damage a domestic industry, policymakers should pursue other options to lower drug costs for consumers. Increased negotiations between insurers and pharma companies, rebates for low-income citizens, and other market-based solutions could achieve cost savings without the downsides of unsafe importation. Protecting both health and innovation should be priorities in crafting drugs policies for the future.",

Requiring registration and certification of recreational drone pilots before allowing them to operate drones freely is a prudent step that balances innovation with safety.  \n\nAccording to estimates, over 1 million drones will take to the skies in the U.S. for recreational purposes within the next 5 years.

Fewer students would have the chance to compete and fewer would have their education funded. \n\nLet's continue supporting student-athletes through scholarships and stipends instead of risking the integrity of collegiate sports. Preserving amateurism ensures the focus stays on education first while still allowing talented athletes to develop their skills.

As more people live longer, healthier lives, it would reduce strain on social security and healthcare systems over time. \n\nSecond, denying access to therapies purely due to expense would be unethical, discriminating against those unable to afford them. Everybody deserves the chance at a longer, higher-quality life. Providing limited public funding or subsidies could help make therapies available to more people, even if not fully covered. \n\nLastly, limiting development and access to anti-aging therapies now would severely hamper medical progress. According to experts at Johns Hopkins, therapies pushing back human aging are on the verge of clinical testing and could be available within a decade or two. But we risk losing decades of progress and the true benefits to humanity if development and research are cut short due to profit concerns alone. \n\nIn summary, while costs are a concern, the potential scientific, medical and economic upside of anti-aging therapies is too great not to pursue vigorously through public and private means. Denying access based on cost discrimination or profit concerns alone risks immense, long-term harm. With reasonable public support and subsidies, these life-changing therapies could be available to improve and extend human life worldwide.",

Of great concern too is the online dangers kids may encounter, from cyberbullies to online predators.  \nA temporary ban on smartphones and social media for under-16s would give kids a better chance at a carefree childhood, avoid serious mental health issues down the road, and help foster stronger family bonds and real-world social skills. Exceptions could be made for educational uses under parental supervision. Overall this policy puts children's well-being first at a time when tech giants' profit motives run counter to that. Our kids deserve the chance to be kids before immersing themselves in virtual worlds.",
